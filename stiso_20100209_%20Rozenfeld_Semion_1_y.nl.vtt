I’m telling you now: when you speak all the languages together, I won’t find people,

07:34.964 --> 07:42.100

I had no profession.

08:21.140 --> 08:21.570

08:21.570 --> 08:34.550
I couldn’t say that I am a plumber, or a timberman, so

Sasha Kuptchin tells me: “My father is a carpenter, come with me, you will help me”. I say

08:44.510 --> 08:48.680

37:47.800 --> 37:55.405
10 km and he was a 10 years old child. He went with his father to the village

37:55.405 --> 38:01.430

This is the memory for them.

38:50.830 --> 38:50.830
Yes.

38:50.830 --> 39:00.630
The whole family lies there. All, all of them lie.

39:00.630 --> 39:08.681
Ehm   You will have to translate now. I want him to talk about his Friday evening

39:08.681 --> 39:15.440
in his house. About going to school. Can he start to try to do that?

39:15.440 --> 39:17.358
Can you tell us how the Friday evening used to look at your home?

39:17.358 --> 39:19.130
How you went to the synagogue. Simply, how your life looked.

39:19.130 --> 39:32.180
Life   In 1930 I was in a Jewish school. In 1930 I went to the first   the first   grade.

39:32.180 --> 39:44.940
In the first grade. In a Jewish school. There, in the Jewish school, I learnt till 1936.

39:44.940 --> 39:51.280
I want to ask   I want to ask

39:51.280 --> 39:51.280
What?

39:51.280 --> 39:56.080
A Jewish school is where you learnt Yiddish or Hebrew?

39:56.080 --> 39:56.080
No! Yiddish]!

39:56.080 --> 39:57.050
Please, don’t do this! This is absolutely

39:57.090 --> 40:07.500
Yiddish]! We have not been taught Hebrew in our school.

40:07.500 --> 40:13.890
I have understood so please, don't   I know the region. Please. Sorry.

40:13.890 --> 40:14.880
OK.

40:16.830 --> 40:17.020
Yes?

40:17.020 --> 40:30.600
In 1936 I graduated from the Jewish school and I moved to an Ukrainian school.

40:30.600 --> 40:30.780
1937?

40:30.780 --> 40:37.920
1936. In 1936 I graduated from the Jewish school and all Jews went to the Ukrainian school.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.550
Why?

40:38.550 --> 40:42.720
They made the Jews do it. The Jewish school   It has been said: enough!

40:43.790 --> 40:47.900
In the year 1936 he went to the  Ukrainian

40:47.900 --> 40:50.130
1937 to the Ukrainian school.

40:50.720 --> 40:50.870
Because

40:50.870 --> 40:51.430
Yes. OK?

40:53.000 --> 40:57.380
Because   eee   they said it's enough. Now you go to

40:57.380 --> 41:00.150
Who said? Who said it's enough?

41:00.150 --> 41:01.570
Who said that you have to

41:04.600 --> 41:07.550
Stalin said   It’s everything from Stalin.

41:07.550 --> 41:09.160
It was from above.

41:09.160 --> 41:20.600
From above. Emmm   Please can you talk about the difference between the two schools.

41:20.600 --> 41:28.780
And what was the difference between these two schools? Between the Jewish

41:28.780 --> 41:37.390
Here one learnt Yiddish and there we learnt only Ukrainian and Russian.

41:37.390 --> 41:42.440
But were there also non-[Jewish children in class? Was it more mixed?

41:42.440 --> 41:56.220
It was mixed. In our class there were 8 Jews. The rest was Ukrainian.  And it was

41:56.220 --> 42:10.681
we used to    there was nothing between us. The headmaster was a Jew]! He graduated

42:10.681 --> 42:22.080
from an university, a Russian university. He taught us mathematics.

42:22.080 --> 42:22.390
I understood.

42:22.390 --> 42:30.960
A Jew.

42:30.960 --> 42:31.110
Mhm.

42:31.110 --> 42:43.560
Later there was an Ukrainian, Kovaltchuk. Everything was fine.

42:43.560 --> 42:43.560
Mhm.

42:43.560 --> 42:43.560
We learnt together, everything fine.

42:43.560 --> 42:43.560
No anti-semitism?

42:43.560 --> 42:44.430
No. Maybe hidden inside there was.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.150
Perhaps inside there was but not outside.

42:47.150 --> 42:48.550
There was a discipline. People were afraid.

42:48.550 --> 42:49.160
Mhm.

42:49.350 --> 42:51.290
Before the war some Jews were important people. Later   Stalin (  .[?  drove Jews out.

42:51.290 --> 43:00.835
It was forbidden. Anti-semitism was forbidden by the authorities. And

43:00.835 --> 43:09.550
the Jews had good positions. Only after the war things changed.

43:09.560 --> 43:13.720
OK, so let us come back to Friday evening to family life.

43:13.720 --> 43:13.720
Friday evening at home. How did it look?

43:13.720 --> 43:25.513
It was not a big room at our place   My father was a tailor. There was a big room where he used

43:25.513 --> 43:37.555
to work   There was an alcove. I was sleeping on a couch   And in the alcove there were two beds.

43:37.555 --> 43:49.224
And between them there stood a table. And there was light. On friday evening my mother used to

43:49.224 --> 43:59.280
come inside, light the candles. So I think every Friday evening she used to bless

43:59.280 --> 44:05.804
Every Friday she would lit the candles and also when the

44:05.804 --> 44:11.630
beginning of the   of a month she would also pray.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.440
Mhm. Was it religious upbringing? Was it religion?

44:14.440 --> 44:17.840
Was it a religious upbringing?

44:17.840 --> 44:21.270
What is it?

44:22.010 --> 44:23.110
A religious home?

44:23.110 --> 44:31.887
No, it wasn’t a religious home, not a religious one   On Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah,

44:31.887 --> 44:40.354
Pesach we used to   go to the synagogue. Otherwise not. Not a religious home   Eee

44:40.354 --> 44:47.480
home. Only  on Friday evening our mother used to light the candles.

44:47.480 --> 44:54.682
It wasn't a religious home but Friday evening they would put on the lights and Rosh Hashanah,

44:54.682 --> 45:01.110
Yom Kippur and Pesach they went to shib Yid.   to the shul Yid.   to the synagogue]

45:01.780 --> 45:09.612
You just told that you were ten when the “big hunger” was there. He was

45:09.612 --> 45:17.340
ten years old when the “big hunger” was there. Just translate, please.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.530
You were there when the “big hunger” was there when you were ten years old.

45:20.650 --> 45:22.170
Yes. In 1932.

45:22.170 --> 45:30.210
Yes. Well, how did you talk about it? Did you know it was part of Soviet policy or?

45:30.210 --> 45:36.650
How did you understand it? Did you understand that it was a Soviet policy? How did you

45:36.650 --> 45:47.683
I did not understand the reason at all! I knew that there is no rain. There was

45:47.683 --> 45:57.600
no rain. It was so dry!  There was no rain so there was nothing to eat.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.200
He understood there were no rains and therefore the wheat did not grow.

46:00.200 --> 46:14.880
One couldn’t do anything   It was   The  fields were  empty. There was hunger.

46:14.880 --> 46:15.580
There was no rain.

46:17.190 --> 46:20.220
How did you   Did you know about communism?

46:20.220 --> 46:29.228
I haven’t thought about the communism, not at all. The small shtetl   what communism

46:29.228 --> 46:36.980
It was   Afterwards I understood, after the war I understood everything.

46:36.980 --> 46:46.870
After the war he understood communism but not when he was in the village.

46:47.030 --> 46:53.790
OK, so did you know the Germans were dangerous?

46:53.790 --> 46:53.790
But did you know that Germans are dangerous?

46:53.790 --> 47:04.016
I knew. I knew, movies have been shown such as: “Family Oppenheimer”, “Professor

47:04.016 --> 47:12.460
Mamlock”. There were movies, we saw them before the war, we knew what

47:12.460 --> 47:16.710
He knew because there were movies.

47:16.710 --> 47:17.960
Well, what could we have done?

47:17.960 --> 47:18.210
Movies.

47:18.210 --> 47:21.590
Yes? Talk what did he more say? He had

47:21.590 --> 47:21.590
"Professor Mamlock"

47:21.890 --> 47:22.920
What is that?

47:23.250 --> 47:23.690
A movie.

47:23.690 --> 47:25.810
“Family Oppenheimer”, movies which existed before the war.

47:25.810 --> 47:26.100
"Oppenheimers"

47:26.100 --> 47:34.638
They have been shown before the war, these movies. Russian movies

47:34.638 --> 47:42.520
in which it was shown how in Germany Jews are being beaten.

47:42.520 --> 47:49.930
There were Soviet movies which showed what they do to the Jews in Germany. How they bit them.

47:49.930 --> 47:53.203
Nobody left straight from Ternivka because there was no railroad. Ternivka, shtetl Ternivka.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.300
The Jews stayed, because they could not run away. The railroad was 30 km from Ternivka.

47:56.300 --> 47:57.940
From Ternivke they could not run away because the

47:57.940 --> 47:57.940
train

47:57.940 --> 47:59.070
railways were not there. Only thirty kilometer

47:59.070 --> 48:03.173
Therefore, the Jews stayed. There was no possibility to escape.  I wasn’t

48:03.173 --> 48:06.730
there   I was in the army and my sisters were not at home either.

48:06.730 --> 48:32.800
Was it normal for a Jewish boy to go to the army?

48:32.800 --> 48:39.470
Was it normal for a Jewish boy to go to the army?

48:39.470 --> 48:45.100
Why not? I was a patriot! I was defending   I was a patriot!

48:45.100 --> 48:57.400
How old were you?

48:59.820 --> 49:06.410
Eighteen. In 1940 I was 18 years old. I went to the army.

49:06.410 --> 49:15.290
I understand. OK. How was it in the army?

49:15.910 --> 49:18.250
How was it in the army?

49:18.250 --> 49:22.060
It was very hard in the army.

49:22.060 --> 49:22.060
Why?

49:22.060 --> 49:31.410
Like in any army   Hard. Later we got used to it. I was a soldier, not a bad one.

49:31.410 --> 49:33.670
And   it was hard but he got used to it, like in any army.

49:33.670 --> 49:44.560
Can you tell a little more? Why was it hard?

49:44.560 --> 49:53.330
Can you maybe tell us more? What were the hardships?

49:53.330 --> 49:53.330
Cold?

49:53.330 --> 49:57.840
Hardships   Do I know what a hardship is?  Life is a hardship, isn’t

49:57.840 --> 50:01.900
it? (  .[?  That everything passes - it is a hardship! Poverty!

50:01.900 --> 50:25.610
Did you have enough food in the army?

50:25.610 --> 50:30.340
In Ternivka? In the army? Good. Good food.

50:30.340 --> 50:30.340
And (..?.) food as well?

50:30.340 --> 50:30.940
And   kosher?

50:30.940 --> 50:43.210
No. No kosher  food. No. No kosher. In the army we were getting all the same.

50:43.210 --> 50:44.160
Ja.

50:45.180 --> 50:49.400
There were from Turkey   Turkish Jews, well, from Reza   no, Rezanya

Reza

50:50.090 --> 50:51.440
Grozny, there were    Islamic

50:51.440 --> 50:53.370
There were Jews from Georgia.

50:53.370 --> 50:58.500
Jews from there were eating everything, just like me. There was no choice.

50:58.500 --> 51:01.280
They ate everything. There was no choice.

51:01.930 --> 51:05.080
Nothing kosher. All the same.

51:05.540 --> 51:20.885
OK. When you for the first time heard of the German army? When was

51:20.885 --> 51:35.300
this? When did he heard for the first time of the German army?

51:35.300 --> 51:37.810
When did you hear for the first time of the German army?

51:37.810 --> 51:39.824
The German army? I heard everything when they occupied Austria , when they occupied

51:39.824 --> 51:41.450
Czechoslovakia   I knew everything   I read newspapers   Everything

51:41.450 --> 51:43.950
I knew everything because I read the papers.

51:43.950 --> 51:46.090
That was not my question.

51:46.090 --> 51:46.750
So?

51:47.130 --> 51:56.540
Sorry, it's OK. When did he   When did his department of the army for the first meet Germans?

52:00.050 --> 52:09.760
A! When did you come into contact with the Germans? For the first time.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.300
For the first time?

52:12.300 --> 52:12.780
In the army.

52:12.780 --> 52:14.190
In the army I wasn’t in contact   I came into contact when I was already a prisoner of war.

52:14.190 --> 52:24.160
In the army when he was he was not in contact with the Germans. Only when he was a prisoner of war.

52:24.160 --> 52:30.150
How was he made

52:30.150 --> 52:38.810
I was an artilleryman. I was shooting from afar

52:38.810 --> 52:38.810
Yes. Where? Where?

52:38.810 --> 52:42.352
Where? Berezina, there was heavy shooting, we destroyed seven

52:42.352 --> 52:45.430
tanks. Panzers, seven Panzers we destroyed. Berezina.

52:46.840 --> 52:52.202
Can he please   I'm trying   What is happening now is that we're getting into this

52:52.202 --> 52:57.499
answer and question and you really have to avoid this. Can he please try to start

52:57.499 --> 53:02.600
talking how he was taken prisoner of war in as much detail as he can remember.

53:02.600 --> 53:18.600
How did it happen   How did you become   you became a prisoner of war? How did it happen?

53:18.600 --> 53:35.733
It happened between Mogilov and Smolensk. A bomb has fallen not far away. I was injured,

53:35.733 --> 53:53.255
a contusion of   A piece of the bomb   iron hit me here, in the foot   But it didn’t cut

53:53.255 --> 54:09.610
off      I had a wound, it got infected. And this is how I became a prisoner of war.

54:09.610 --> 54:16.888
And   Can he talk further how it happened   He must talk, please, ask him

54:16.888 --> 54:23.970
Please ask him to talk, don't get him to this question and answer play.

54:23.970 --> 54:24.170
You were wounded.

54:24.170 --> 54:24.170
Yes.

54:24.170 --> 54:25.150
And   And then came

54:25.150 --> 54:42.435
We were brought, driven to Minsk   to Minsk   In Minsk there was a (..?.) camp for 80000 prisoners

54:42.435 --> 54:59.191
of war. In Minsk. We were divided: Russians - out!, Ukrainians - out!, Jews went out. I already

54:59.191 --> 55:12.420
told, 230 Jews left, they were brought to the Minsk camp on Szeroka street.

55:12.420 --> 55:19.540
How was it in the camp?

55:19.540 --> 55:21.850
How   Tell us about the camp . Tell us about the Minsk camp.

55:21.850 --> 55:32.713
I’m telling. While in the camp, we used to receive food once a day. No bread, not at all. A

55:32.713 --> 55:43.460
lot of people died from hunger. Until spring 1942 maybe 15 Jews remained from the total 230.

55:43.460 --> 55:43.650
And then?

55:43.650 --> 55:51.105
Then   Then more Jews were brought   We started to work, we started to get better food. And after

55:51.105 --> 55:58.329
work we used to get a bit of potatoes. Life became a bit easier, nobody was dying from hunger.

55:58.329 --> 56:05.170
In spring 1942 everybody was getting food. We used to go   work   We were receiving food.

56:07.970 --> 56:14.480
I do have a last question before I suggest to stop.

56:14.480 --> 56:17.160
One more   One more question before

56:17.160 --> 56:22.100
When you went to the army, did you see your parents for the last time?

56:22.100 --> 56:25.710
When you went to the army, did you see your parents for the last time?

56:25.710 --> 56:32.340
Yes, it was November 1940. I said goodbye to them. We did not see each other later

56:32.340 --> 56:42.030
Please, tell me. How did it happen?

56:42.030 --> 56:45.600

57:13.363 --> 57:23.500
our soldiers to be sent to Latvia and I came to Latvia. Daugavpils in November 1940.

57:23.500 --> 57:23.680
And how   Where were your parents when you?

57:23.680 --> 57:23.680
Where were your parents?

57:23.680 --> 57:23.680
They stayed in Ternovka.

57:23.680 --> 57:23.680
They remained in Ternovka.

57:23.680 --> 57:23.680
stayed in Ternivka.

57:23.680 --> 57:27.490
Were they in the room or in the gate or   Did they stand in the

57:27.490 --> 57:31.120
door, in the room? Tell me, please! Where were they? Where?!

57:31.120 --> 57:48.880
They remained at home.

57:48.880 --> 57:48.990
Where?

57:48.990 --> 57:52.320
What does she want?

57:52.320 --> 57:53.620

In their room.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.670
In the room.

57:58.670 --> 58:00.440
But

58:05.760 --> 58:08.020
In their room!

58:08.020 --> 58:25.380
But when he did see them for the last time   Where?

58:25.380 --> 58:29.380
When you saw them for the last time.

58:29.380 --> 58:31.330
In November 1940.

58:31.330 --> 58:32.100
Where were they?

58:32.100 --> 58:41.840
In the room. In the room. I left and they stayed in the room.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.470
And you really said goodbye.

58:43.470 --> 58:44.480
And then you said

58:44.480 --> 58:46.228
I didn’t tell them anything   Who could have known

58:46.228 --> 58:47.910
that we will be sent and will receive an order now

58:47.910 --> 58:53.850
Who could have   He left, who could have saw that it would be the last time.

58:53.850 --> 58:59.660
We didn’t know that we will have to fight on the territories of the enemy.

58:59.660 --> 59:13.790
Who could have thought about it that he will afterwards have to fight on territoria of the enemy.

59:13.790 --> 59:13.930
Yes.

59:13.930 --> 59:15.250
Pause. Pause. I take a picture of you now.

59:15.250 --> 59:18.550
I am already a bit tired and would like to finish.

I believe so.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.840

After the war, did you come back to the shtetl?

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:12.220
I haven’t been in Ternivka for a long lime because those people

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.370
were dead. I went to Khoschevato to my uncle, there I met

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:23.141

What kind of a person was it? What kind of a man was it?

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.195
It was a good organizer, Pechersky. After the war I found   I didn’t know that he is alive.

01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:45.345
I didn’t know that Pechersky is alive. I found Pechersky in 1963. In 1963 I found out

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:49.542
that Pechersky is alive. I found out that Vayspapir is alive. I went to Rastov, there we

01:02:53.692 --> 01:02:57.270
people. I worked 25 years in Gayvoron. Before Odessa, I worked in Gayvoron.

01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:07.841

01:03:07.841 --> 01:03:16.210
of the uprising. In 1978 we organized the 25th anniversary of the uprising.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:16.210
Was it a good man?

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:24.490
Pechersky? He was a good man. His (..?.) was not Jewish but Russian but he was a good person.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:24.700
[break]

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.896

01:03:36.976 --> 01:03:40.360
little bit about his life after he was  after the war was ended.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.288
And I want to talk a little bit about this picture of forty-six,

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:49.600
about the survivors that he explains to me who they are.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.950
This one?

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:53.100
No it’s this one, the one he showed me yesterday.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.691
She has  She will be glad to talk also about the photograph(s) and, if there will

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:09.070
After the war.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:09.670

That’s one thing, and another: yesterday you showed her (a) picture(s) of year, the year 1946,

there’s a group of people, and she would like to know something about them, if you can.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:32.840
A group of people, that’s  in Ternovka’s

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:29.060
They had come from several cities, and  into the Soviet Union.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:37.516
One second. Тhe picture he showed you at the graveyard, this is the one you’re talking about, he says,

OK.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.780

This shot was taken in 1960, that  that’s almost fifty years ago by now laughs.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.360
She would like to know a little bit about  about  about these people, a few.

How you met your wife.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:39.450
Well, I demobilized in November 1945, and from Berlin I came to Ternovka.

01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:53.403
And after that they used to give in all the ceremonies the

01:19:53.403 --> 01:19:58.410
medals for participating in the victory over the Germans.

01:19:58.410 --> 01:19:58.750
Thank you.

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:00.070

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.640

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.110
She already yesterday photographed (it).

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.800
She said that she knows but she wants another time.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.140
Mmm.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:30.670
OK, I make one more.

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:34.520
? laughs

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.610
So I want him to read this.

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:39.330
Mm. To the camera.

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:42.610
Would he, to the camera, the, the text that he just read before

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:42.760
Mm.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:47.440
Would he mind to read it, because it will make it easier to show it, in wherever

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:54.760
She asks if you can read that which you wro  wrote down.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.350
Yes I can.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:21:04.040
And, and you don’t have to translate, because it will be translated. Tell him please.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:08.416
And  besides  apart from that, this they will, it will by them, they will make a translation

01:21:08.416 --> 01:21:12.460
litt. transmission so as to be understandable also to those who don’t know Russian.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:26.450
And I’ll send him the translation, so he can use it.

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:30.080
And she will send you, er, the transmission if you will want with her

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:30.550
Thank you.

01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:32.270
In English.

01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:33.163
The schizophrenic Hitler and his clique – “Deutschland

01:21:33.163 --> 01:21:33.810
ueber alles” is the basis of their call.

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.570
In that gibberish, in this gibberish the German philistine believed with the greatest ease.

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:38.323
From small to great they screamed “Heil”, and those who didn’t

01:21:38.323 --> 01:21:39.690
scream “Heil” perished in the concentration camp.

01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:39.690
And such honest Germans existed, not a few.

01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:42.810
For this gibberish the people of the Earth paid a very high price.

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:53.148
Our hunted people, the people of the Thora book, paid with mountains of corpses,

01:21:53.148 --> 01:22:01.420
and with the ashes of Dachau, Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Sobibor.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:06.050
This is what you get from schizophrenic gibberish.

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:16.443
But the end went, the end came to the patience of our people, the

01:22:16.443 --> 01:22:25.800
fires of the Warsaw ghetto flared up in the twinkling of an eye.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.220
The Warsaw Jews stood firm: twenty days no fascist foot was set into the ghetto.

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.660
In the footsteps of the courageous Warsawers Sobibor death camp rose.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.940
With axes, with knives we killed the fascists.

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:35.520
We tore apart the barbwire with our bare hands.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.840
The fourteenth of October became a funeral repast for eleven fascists.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:48.780
This day was for many prisoners their last one.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.320
They gave their lives not in vain, Sobibor death camp was extinguished forever.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.860
At our horizon an extinguished star was reborn, a star of hope, a star

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.180
of life, a star of freedom, and this star is called: Israel.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.943
May this star shine for the Jews in all, always, always, two

01:22:57.943 --> 01:22:59.530
thousand years we, the Jews, have waited for this day.

01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:07.585
Well, this is dedicated to the sixty-fifth anniversary of the day of

01:23:07.585 --> 01:23:14.930
the insurrection in Sobibor death camp, 14th of October, 1943.

01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:25.974
On the picture to the right the leader of the insurrection, Alexandr Pechersky, who left

01:23:25.974 --> 01:23:35.890
us on the 19th of January, 1990, in Rostov-on-Don. Blessed forever be his name.

01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:42.052

He’s the author.

01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:55.320
Why did he write it? Can you ask him?

01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:01.970
Er, can you, she asks, why did you write this text?

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.570
Well, this tormented me, I had to speak out.

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:08.540

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.890
him and he sa he had a need to to let it out, to tell it

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:15.500
I met in Berlin a lot of Germans.

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:15.680
Mm.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.308

When he was in Berlin, he met many Germans, he spoke very good German.

And he also met a dentist, who took care of his tooth, that during

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:55.350
Mm.

01:24:55.350 --> 01:25:01.748
Not far from Berlin there were these Ribbentrop stables, the hippodrome of Ribbentrop,

01:25:01.748 --> 01:25:07.700
there in that place, there were many rooms and an army ration dump was organized

he was in charge of all this area, this was what he did in Berlin.

01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:46.350
So who is Pechersky, to the left or to the right?

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.330

is to come at four o’clock to fetch a cupboard that is being made to his order. Can

01:32:00.315 --> 01:32:04.170
you kill him with an axe? I say, Yes, (he:) Well, prepare yourselves.

01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:04.170
One little second, I, eeer

01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:04.970
Let’s get on.

01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:13.294
He says, he knew that something was going on, but it was all top secret, and

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:21.291
on, er, October 14th Pechersky came to him, he was working at the, at the

01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:28.629
workshop and he told, and he came to the workshop and told him that

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.520
Who must come?

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:30.730
Frenzel [?]?

01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:31.350
Frenzel, [?] Frenzel.

01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:35.700
Frenzel is about, need to come and pick up a, er, a

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.970
A coat.

01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:39.970
Something, a cloth or something.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:40.650
Ja.

01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:46.990
Can you kill him with an axe, and he said, yes I can.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:58.122
From this, from the window of this carpenter’s workshop, (we) chose especially this, er, carpenter’s

01:32:58.122 --> 01:33:03.702
workshop, so that from there would be visible the entry to the cobbler’s workshop, where Shubayev

01:33:03.702 --> 01:33:09.282
and still another one were standing. The entry to that cobbler’s (workshop) were standing Arkadiy

01:33:09.282 --> 01:33:14.750
Wayspapir and Loytman, in the tailor’s workshop Shubayev and yet with another one. Patsebulshky

01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:19.260
they put in the second camp, there four Germans worked, and he had to kill them.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:20.200
And all this sss, and during one hour, from four till five on the 14th of October.

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:28.603
And they picked this, er, special place, this place in the workshop, because it was very

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:36.720
comfortable, because they could see the, whoever was coming from the Germans and, er,

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.814
he told me about other friends of his that were situated in different places and

01:33:40.814 --> 01:33:44.550
were not been prepared. Cause I don’t really remember I have to ask him

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.550
OK

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:45.050
over again.

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.390
It’s OK.

01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:52.942
And, er, he said that all the killing of the Germans had to take place during

01:33:52.942 --> 01:33:59.220
one hour between four and five in the afternoon on October 14th.

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.162
There, into the cobbler’s and tailor’s (workshops)

01:34:03.162 --> 01:34:06.740
the Germans came, and there they dealt with them.

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:07.140
Mm.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.107
Frenzel didn’t come to the carpenter’s (workshop),

01:34:08.107 --> 01:34:09.040
they sent him somewhere for an urgent cause. He then

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:14.030
Frenzel, Frenzel didn’t come to the workshop, he was sent away to

01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:18.198
Therefore, I didn’t fulfil the task, but Pechersky didn’t mind, he

01:34:18.198 --> 01:34:22.010
says, because of one swine we won’t lo  lose the insurrection.

01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:27.539
He, he didn’t, he was, he didn’t, because Frenzel didn’t come, he couldn’t

01:34:27.539 --> 01:34:32.260
kill him, but Pechersky said, for one German we will not stop the, the

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:32.940
Revolt.

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.100
The revolt.

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:39.112
At five o’clock, when Patsebulshky came from there, from the second camp, singing, already there

01:34:39.112 --> 01:34:44.074
that the Dutchmen also worked in the second camp, he comes with songs and that means, means, that

01:34:44.074 --> 01:34:49.291
he killed four Germans, Shubayev, Shagal, Patsebulshky comes with songs, he took out his pistol, fired

01:34:49.291 --> 01:34:53.690
into the air, yelled, For the Motherland, for Stalin, forward! And we started running.

01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:53.690
At five o’clock

01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:53.690
I understood.

01:34:53.690 --> 01:34:53.930
OK.

01:34:53.930 --> 01:35:00.846
I ran with the axe to the barbwire behind [?] premises and wanted to chop off the wire,

01:35:00.846 --> 01:35:08.081
I didn’t succeed, I dropped the axe, climbed over the wire, three-meter fence and a short

01:35:08.081 --> 01:35:15.077
run (across) into the forest, in the forest I felt, in my leg something hurts, I looked,

01:35:15.077 --> 01:35:21.120
there a bullet had torn its way through the flesh, I didn’t pay attention.

01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:29.030
He run over to the fence with an axe, the wired fence, and tried to open the door

01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:30.320
And he climbed over.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:35.088
And he climbed over, and then at, at the forest he felt that something was,

01:35:35.088 --> 01:35:39.730
er, bothering him, and he was hu  he saw that he had a bullet in his leg.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.192
There on that spot where we had made it to the woods, there were about fifty people,

01:35:46.192 --> 01:35:51.777
they had ran to other places, but they all the same ran up lumping together, and there,

01:35:51.777 --> 01:35:56.400
where we were, fifty people, we went for twenty-four hours all together.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:02.499
Er, he, they got to a point in the woods, er, at a certain point there were fifty people,

01:36:02.499 --> 01:36:08.187
but many others escaped to different directions, but his group, where he was, there

01:36:08.187 --> 01:36:13.190
were fifty of them, and for twenty-four hours they were walking together.

01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:13.190
Mm.

01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:18.674
We de  we understood, that this way, fifty people, we won’t

01:36:18.674 --> 01:36:23.350
be able to hide, we must split up into small groups.

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:25.620
They understood that they had to separate into smaller groups.

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:30.582
We split up, I more to Freyberg and Ramler, he died two years ago, and

01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:35.615
we walked on and came to Khelm, five kilometers from Khelm in the woods

01:36:35.615 --> 01:36:40.010
we met two brothers, who had escaped from the pogrom in Khelm.

01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:42.870
Er, they, he and his friend walked to, walked towards

01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:43.300
Khelm.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:47.843
Khelm, and about five kilometers from Khelm they met

01:36:47.843 --> 01:36:52.300
two, er, two guys, who escaped the pogrom in Khelm.

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:56.110
And that he has already told yesterday, so let’s cut it short.

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:56.440
OK.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.680

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.850
Because he already did, told at the other time.

01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:16.110
