WEBVTT

00:11.500 --> 00:29.618
My name is Philip Bialowicz and I was born in Izbica Poland, near Lublin area and eh I came

00:29.618 --> 00:47.140
from a small town very vibrant community, 99% Jewish. And eh the majority were Chassidi.

00:47.140 --> 00:47.910
They were Chassidic?

00:47.910 --> 00:58.048
Chassidic. And eh the rabbi, the rabbi von, von ×”×™ which [here] a century ago, was, his

00:58.048 --> 01:08.072
name Mortre Josef [rabbi Mordechai Josef Leiner?] he was very famous, he wrote the book,

01:08.072 --> 01:18.211
about the mysticism and the book was translated in eh many languages. He was also advisor

01:18.211 --> 01:28.121
to kings and to the government. He was also advise, eh, not only to Jews but Christians

01:28.121 --> 01:38.259
too. They came for his advise. Eh I came from a family of eh six children, three brothers

01:38.259 --> 01:48.170
and three sisters. Eh we we were, we were religious, but not Chassidic. And my brother,

01:48.170 --> 01:56.599
my, my, my father was very active in the community and one of the leaders.

01:56.770 --> 01:57.780
In what sense?

01:57.780 --> 02:02.640
We, we had eh, we had a business in, in a leather factory

02:02.640 --> 02:02.640
Aha

02:03.800 --> 02:08.521
and eh and eh, I came to the, eh, the leather factory helped

02:08.521 --> 02:12.850
us a little bit survive during the war, because we were

02:12.850 --> 02:12.970
Why?

02:12.970 --> 02:24.240
well, we were producing leather for the Germans. And this postponed our, our eh

02:24.240 --> 02:24.400
Deportation

02:24.400 --> 02:34.136
deportation. Eh, Izbica was a very poor woll (?) community, we didn't have any eh industrial

02:34.136 --> 02:43.769
base and eh the children, the, eh, the, eh, the children eh graduated public school, they had

02:43.769 --> 02:53.920
to go to another city to study or to get a job. Because there was no jobs in Izbica. Eh my brother

02:53.920 --> 03:02.000
Simcha studied to be a pharmacist and eh thank to my brother I am alive today.

03:02.000 --> 03:02.000
I know, I know.

03:02.290 --> 03:12.348
And eh Izbica was very poor and u, my parents used to, used to give money to help for the Shabbat,

03:12.348 --> 03:21.997
to go around to help Jew poor people to, with food for the Shabbat. And also we borrowed money

03:21.997 --> 03:32.158
for no, with no, with no interest of people to be able to survive, to go in business. And eh Izbica

03:32.158 --> 03:42.012
we could, we could speak about Izbica eh days, to tell the story about Izbica before the war and

03:42.012 --> 03:51.660
during the war. But then the war broke out, Izbica became a waystation for the Jews of Europe.

03:51.660 --> 04:01.514
Because, I was told that Izbica was mentioned in the Wannsee Conference, that Izbica should take

04:01.514 --> 04:11.265
a big, big part in the, in the in the liquidation of the Jewish people. Because they brought to

04:11.265 --> 04:18.040
Izbica eh from different eh, from different from different states.

04:18.040 --> 04:26.434
Like Tsjechoslovakia and eh, and, and Germany and with Germany I have a very big stories about Germany.

04:26.434 --> 04:34.665
That the German eh transport came from Germany and the Judenrat assigned a family, name Rosenbergers,

04:34.665 --> 04:43.466
which is in my book, the story about the Rosenbergers, a couple with two daughters and one of the daughters,

04:43.466 --> 04:51.453
Herta, was mine, girlfriend, was a teenager, was mine age. Approximately. Those, we lived together

04:51.453 --> 04:59.766
like eh, like eh, they, like wha, despite the, the, the adjustment was very difficult because of they,

04:59.766 --> 05:07.834
they came from aristatic family, aristocratic family and we were very eh plain people in Izbica. So

05:07.834 --> 05:13.050
it took time to adjustment, but we lived together like one unit.

05:13.050 --> 05:15.060
How did you come to live together? That's not clear to me.

05:15.060 --> 05:15.060
Huh?

05:15.660 --> 05:18.110
How did you come to live together?

05:18.110 --> 05:20.270
So they, they assigned, they assigned

05:20.270 --> 05:20.270
To live with you

05:20.270 --> 05:23.020
the Judenrat assigned the family that we should live toge, they should

05:23.020 --> 05:23.020
Okay

05:23.020 --> 05:24.190
live in our house

05:24.190 --> 05:24.830
Okay

05:24.830 --> 05:29.940
because they doesn't, eh, we didn't have enough room to, to give a special eh, facilities.

05:29.940 --> 05:29.940
Hmhm

05:29.940 --> 05:39.802
And eh the Rosenberger used to give me jewelry to go out to sell and they used the money

05:39.802 --> 05:49.441
to live, to live eh, for food and for live together. And eh eh eh the story about very

05:49.441 --> 05:59.528
interesting story, that one day a Mercedes came over in front of the house and the Gestapo

05:59.528 --> 06:07.710
came out with, with, from the, from the car, with a package under his arm

06:07.710 --> 06:08.730
Hmhm

06:10.540 --> 06:19.248
and then he walked in to my house, so I was, I was under the impression that he

06:19.248 --> 06:28.397
came to kill us. A German Gestapo came, came to kill us. I was hiding in the house,

06:28.397 --> 06:37.436
when he came in, the parents, they hug each other and, the, the wife, Rosenbergers

06:37.436 --> 06:43.940
wife made coffee and, and I was hi, I was shaking, how, how

06:43.940 --> 06:44.290
Of course!

06:44.290 --> 06:44.400
I think what is going on here?

06:44.400 --> 06:44.880
Of course

06:44.880 --> 06:52.291
And he eh he made a plan he, I, I understood that he give them a,

06:52.291 --> 06:59.360
a opt.., he, he is assigning a job for him to work in ZamoÅ›Ä‡

06:59.360 --> 06:59.490
Ja?

06:59.490 --> 07:07.598
which is 21 kilometer from Izbica and to work in the airport as an engineer. And they spend, he spend

07:07.598 --> 07:15.305
a half an hour, when he left I asked Herta, my girlfriend, I said, tell me, what's going on? A

07:15.305 --> 07:23.173
German Gestapo comes, you hug each other, you made coffee, tell me what ha, what, what, what, tell

07:23.173 --> 07:30.881
me the truth. She said to me eh, Fischer he was named, Fischer, I cannot reveal the sto, this is

07:30.881 --> 07:38.668
a, this is a, this is a, this is a secret only for the family. So I said your father told me that

07:38.668 --> 07:46.616
I am a member of the family, when the war will be over you'll take me to Germany, and I'll have

07:46.616 --> 07:54.323
a good life. So you shouldn't have any secrets from me. When he came the next time, I insisted

07:54.323 --> 08:02.031
you must tell me. We took a blanket, we went to the forest and she revealed that he is a distant

08:02.031 --> 08:10.541
cousin, he's Jewish. He's a distant cousin, he works eleven kilometers away from Izbica in Krasnystaw,

08:10.541 --> 08:15.840
[geluid op achtergrond] it's between, between ZamoÅ›Ä‡, because.

08:15.840 --> 08:24.560
I know where it is, ja, thank you.

08:25.320 --> 08:34.166
And he helps us and he helps other people here. So I told her, if he is a Gestapo, he must have

08:34.166 --> 08:43.012
on his conscience eh many, eh, maybe he killed many Jews. You know. He said eh FisheÅ‚e [Filip]

08:43.012 --> 08:51.951
he is not a murderer, he is a, he works, he is assignment is on transportation from the army to,

08:51.951 --> 09:00.704
to Russia. And eh and then I, I asked, maybe, maybe the Rosenbergers are spies. Maybe they are

09:00.704 --> 09:09.737
working together with him as eh spies. Because when the transports came from Germany, they still,

09:09.737 --> 09:19.048
many of them came with the first, First War, First War medals on them. And they were so eh dedicated

09:19.048 --> 09:28.081
Germans, you know? But I could not, I could not absorb, I could not believe a, a Jewish who would

09:28.081 --> 09:36.834
be a Gestapo, you know? But eh, the, the, he could not save him. They went to Sobibor too. And

09:36.834 --> 09:42.980
he, he, he, he was caught in Krakau and he, he, he was killed. His

09:42.980 --> 09:43.610
Really?

09:43.610 --> 09:50.054
his name is Frenz, was Frenz. Maybe he had a pseudonym, his name was

09:50.054 --> 09:55.740
Fr, Frenz. So this is eh, one of the very important episodes

09:55.760 --> 09:56.310
It is!

09:56.310 --> 10:03.833
which, which eh, I was in the, in the, the, they were interesting to make a, to make a movie out

10:03.833 --> 10:11.514
of this, years ago, about that story. But I couldn't eh, I couldn't go into making movies that

10:11.514 --> 10:19.194
time, it was years ago, because I had a tragedy in my family and eh my head was not to go and make

10:19.194 --> 10:26.953
movies because I lost a daughter, she was seventeen years old. It's in the book and how she wrote

10:26.953 --> 10:34.398
an article about, eh, she wrote herself. She also wrote her own eulogy before she died. She was

10:34.398 --> 10:40.590
very smart, educated and eh she was more concerned about me than about herself.

10:40.820 --> 10:41.450
What did she die from?

10:41.450 --> 10:43.870
She died from bone cancer.

10:43.870 --> 10:43.870
Gosh

10:43.870 --> 10:43.870
From the leg

10:43.870 --> 10:44.630
how terrible.

10:44.630 --> 10:51.674
like the same things like Kennedy still have. Maybe they would amputate her leg, maybe she would

10:51.674 --> 10:58.719
be alive, but eh she is like, was a girl, a beautiful girl, is, eh, eh, there is a picture of it

10:58.719 --> 11:05.250
in the, in the, my book. It was a big tragedy and I didn't go into make any, I didn't

11:05.250 --> 11:05.770
Of course not

11:05.770 --> 11:09.910
I thought not was to go and make movies.

11:09.910 --> 11:09.910
Of course not.

11:09.910 --> 11:12.820
So, I have, I'm go from here back and forward, so I have many

11:12.820 --> 11:13.620
That's okay

11:13.620 --> 11:18.254
ma, many stories to tell about mine experiences, eh, before

11:18.254 --> 11:22.810
the war and during the war and after the war. But the main

11:23.090 --> 11:27.540
Philip, when you talk about this, this wo, girl, did

11:27.540 --> 11:31.820
she become your girlfriend, this woman Rosenfield?

11:31.820 --> 11:32.460
From Germany?

11:32.460 --> 11:32.570
Yes

11:32.570 --> 11:39.510
She, she was mine age. A young girl. Two, two sisters and she became my girlfriend.

11:39.510 --> 11:40.010
Sure

11:40.010 --> 11:44.934
And we were talking, it's in the book everything, we were talking about the future,

11:44.934 --> 11:48.990
but, eh, but the parents, they said like I'm a member of the family.

11:48.990 --> 11:50.190
Sure. I'm just asking.

11:50.190 --> 11:50.190
Yeah.

11:50.190 --> 11:50.190
How large was your family?

11:50.190 --> 11:50.190
Huh?

11:50.190 --> 11:53.340
How many brothers and sisters did you have?

11:53.340 --> 11:59.830
There was two sisters in (?) two sisters. So the you read the book, the whole

11:59.830 --> 12:05.900
story about it, eh, and eh, they had, I have their pictures in the book.

12:06.040 --> 12:10.742
Yeah, but the people who look at this video, they don't have the book, so, I'm

12:10.742 --> 12:15.100
sorry [laughs], they, they don't have it at this moment, so, let us try to

12:15.100 --> 12:18.080
In the book you can buy it, they, they can, they, they, they, they can

12:18.080 --> 12:18.080
Sure, I will, I will

12:18.080 --> 12:18.480
buy, they can buy my book

12:18.480 --> 12:24.100
I promise to mention it, absolutely, I show a picture from the book when it's out

12:24.370 --> 12:24.860
Yeah.

12:24.860 --> 12:27.740
No, no question about it. I mean, I do what you want.

12:29.580 --> 12:39.858
Izbica all Izbica should be a cemetery. What happened during the war in Izbica, that's indescribable.

12:39.858 --> 12:49.537
Where many thousands of people died and they were shot. Izbica could not absorb so many thousands

12:49.537 --> 12:59.316
of people. Because be, be, because of the sanitary reasons, no health department. Even the doctors

12:59.316 --> 13:09.295
died, typhus developed, even the doctors died with the patients. And eh many, many of them died from

13:09.295 --> 13:16.680
Engels in camp, you know, eh, you know the story about Engels from Izbica.

13:16.680 --> 13:16.860
No?

13:16.860 --> 13:17.960
Tom Blatt told you about Engels?

13:17.960 --> 13:19.000
No, he didn't.

13:19.170 --> 13:19.590
Huh?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.480
He didn't.

13:21.480 --> 13:28.541
Engels was a, was a Gestapo, who was assigned to Izbica, the other one guy was Klemm. The,

13:28.541 --> 13:35.525
the, the Engels, he had, he, every morning he had to, he had to shot ten, fifteen people,

13:35.525 --> 13:41.410
and in the afternoon, this was his his satisfaction. And he was a murderer.

13:41.410 --> 13:42.740
Oh

13:42.890 --> 13:52.354
And eh and eh, and, and also he was helped by, by, by, by the Volksdeutsche Schulz. I don't know

13:52.354 --> 14:02.012
if Toivi Blatt told you about the Schulz. Schulz was a watch maker before the war. In Izbica. But he

14:02.012 --> 14:11.669
was a Volksdeutch. I write in my book, when I went to I went to, to pay him my, my father's watch,

14:11.669 --> 14:21.520
you know, when I came to pick up my watch and eh when I paid for him, he said eh, in, he said, he said

14:21.520 --> 14:31.661
instead in Polish DziÄ™kujÄ™ he said danke schÃ¶n. When I, when I paid him (?) and he was a big murderer.

14:31.661 --> 14:41.319
He was a, he was a helper to Engels, the Gestapo. Fact is eh, it's, it's a very funny thing with

14:41.319 --> 14:50.976
the Engels that after the war he went to Hamburg and he opened a cafÃ© with a Jews eh, with a Jewish

14:50.976 --> 15:00.634
partner. And eh, they, they arrested him, he committed suicide in the, in, in jail. Engels. So there

15:00.634 --> 15:10.292
is many my mother my mother was shot in Iz, Izbica in, on the cemetery with a group of people. I was

15:10.292 --> 15:16.279
also put to, under the firing squad with a group of people and

15:16.280 --> 15:17.060
In the what?

15:17.060 --> 15:19.030
from the fi, firing squad

15:19.030 --> 15:20.230
yes, in the firing squad, yes?

15:20.230 --> 15:28.111
and when they started to shoot I fell down and I made believe that I'm dead. People fall on, by, on

15:28.111 --> 15:35.836
top of me, they were injured, they, they were not even dead yet. And there was all blooded and, but

15:35.836 --> 15:43.639
I made myself a s, place to, a spot to, to breath. And after they left I went down from the cemetery

15:43.639 --> 15:51.599
to the city down, eh, and it was on a hill, you know the cemetery of Izbica? And eh from the transport

15:51.599 --> 15:59.558
it was like a pogrom all kinds of clothing, so I, I, I put on an old dress and I washed myself on the,

15:59.558 --> 16:07.283
for I was blooded. And I came back I came back to the hiding place all my family was there. Because

16:07.283 --> 16:15.165
I went out from the hiding place to get water, because my, my mother got sick and my sisters gave her

16:15.165 --> 16:22.968
compresses with urine. So there was no water. I couldn't, I couldn't stand, I couldn't eh, eh,

16:22.968 --> 16:30.927
this. So I went out to get water, the, so the Polish eh firemen caught me, they took me to the Gestapo

16:30.927 --> 16:38.730
and they took us out to the cemetery and they, they shot us. And they didn't know what happened to

16:38.730 --> 16:46.690
me. I came back ten o'clock at night, back. I didn't even tell them what happened, I didn't want

16:46.690 --> 16:54.571
to, eh, my mother should know what happened to me, that I was shot. So it's a, the experiences what

16:54.571 --> 17:02.452
I went through in Izbica during the war is indescribable and it's, it's, it's impossible to de,

17:02.452 --> 17:10.178
to, to describe what, what happened in Izbica. So many people died from hunger, from, from, from s,

17:10.178 --> 17:14.860
from typhus and, and, eh, by, by executed, by shooting them.

17:14.860 --> 17:16.150
You were born in which year?

17:16.150 --> 17:17.000
Huh?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.340
In which year you were born?

17:19.340 --> 17:24.340
I was born eh, on, de, December 25, '25.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.830
So you were fifteen when the war broke out?

17:25.830 --> 17:33.456
Yes, yes. So I was a teenager. So eh, coming to eh, I was working in Izbica s, Simcha was

17:33.456 --> 17:41.168
working in the hospital and he was like a, like a, the assistant of the doctor, he eh, had

17:41.168 --> 17:48.110
a pharmacist and, and eh, and they made me as a disinfector. To go around and dis

17:48.110 --> 17:49.300
He told me, he told me

17:49.300 --> 17:49.300
Yes?

17:49.300 --> 17:49.300
yes

17:49.300 --> 17:57.113
Dis, disinfect eh, the houses. With the, with the, with eh, with one, with one of the doctor's son.

17:57.113 --> 18:04.849
Because after they, eh they took the people out to, to eh, to the, to Belzec and Sobibor. Belzec and

18:04.849 --> 18:12.739
Sobibor were, a, were approximately the same distance. Two deathcamps and the, and the location Izbica

18:12.739 --> 18:19.470
was very good for the Germans to transportation. You know, with the, with the railroad.

18:19.910 --> 18:22.110
Did you know

18:22.210 --> 18:22.330
Huh?

18:22.330 --> 18:28.470
what Belzec and Sobibor were when you were still in Izbica?

18:28.470 --> 18:29.710
We knew Belzec and Sobibor. We knew this is two deathcamps.

18:29.710 --> 18:30.420
You knew

18:30.420 --> 18:38.991
You know, most of the Jews, Polish Jews knew that the deathcamps, this is this is deathcamps. People

18:38.991 --> 18:47.047
from Holland, they didn't know that's a deathcamp, because, because, when I tell you I'm

18:47.047 --> 18:55.704
going to go into to, to, to Sobibor, I tell you the story about, about the beginning how they arrived

18:55.704 --> 19:02.390
everything. So eh so Izbica they came in 1943, Izbica became Juden, Judenrein.

19:02.390 --> 19:02.520
Yes

19:02.520 --> 19:10.885
In 1942. So, many Jews escaped to the woods in the winter they were frozen and f, f, frozen white,

19:10.885 --> 19:18.824
so they, they wanted to make, the, the Germans wanted to have it and they wanted to have them

19:18.824 --> 19:26.848
in one place. To made Judenstadt. But this was temporarily only. So with Judenstadt they made,

19:26.848 --> 19:34.787
was about few hundred people in Izbica left. And I and my brother and two sisters and a niece

19:34.787 --> 19:42.812
were still alive. My mother was shot and one sister, my father was, took, was taken to Sobibor

19:42.812 --> 19:50.921
and my, my, one of my sisters with a, with a little boy, also to, they took them to Sobibor. So

19:50.921 --> 19:58.860
we remained, part of the family was still alive. When the Warsaw ghetto uprising started they

19:58.860 --> 20:07.141
liquidated all the ghettos in Poland. And they came and they, they, they find us, we had a hiding

20:07.141 --> 20:15.336
place underground, in the factory from the, from the leather factory. And the German, the Polish

20:15.336 --> 20:23.275
people they knew that there is a lot of Jews here. That they went in with the, they went with

20:23.275 --> 20:31.726
the ears to listen, to the walls. You know? But with children, we didn't have any air yet inside,

20:31.726 --> 20:39.921
so they find us and they took us out, the Germans, and they took us to the market place and they

20:39.921 --> 20:47.945
couldn't make a transport with the trains, so then, so they had trucks. Trucks, and they put

20:47.945 --> 20:52.470
us on the trucks and they took us to, to Sobibor. And

20:52.470 --> 20:52.470
Can we

20:52.470 --> 20:58.766
before we went to Sobibor, they stopped in Travnika. They were going to let us into,

20:58.766 --> 21:05.586
Trawnika, but the Trawnika did not accept us. So eh Travni, if I would have go to Trawnika,

21:05.586 --> 21:11.958
I wouldn't, I wouldn't be here today, because they killed 20,000 Jews right after

21:11.958 --> 21:16.830
the, after they escape. They, they, they executed 20,000 eh Jews.

21:16.830 --> 21:23.295
Can I, can I come back one moment to Izbica your life there before we go to Sobibor. Eh,

21:23.295 --> 21:29.540
what kind of life did you have, did, what kind of future did you expect for yourself?

21:29.540 --> 21:37.233
Izbica, like I mentioned, was a vibrant Jewish community. Izbica did not the most of the people,

21:37.233 --> 21:45.007
the Jewish people, most of them were poor. They didn't have, they, they didn't have any money

21:45.007 --> 21:52.461
to live. The, the most of they live from, eh, charities. Because there was no eh, there is no

21:52.461 --> 21:59.995
jobs, eh, most of them were Chassidic, you know, and eh, (?) a few people which, which managed

21:59.995 --> 22:07.688
to, to eh, didn't got, (?) like mine, my, my parents, my father. He was a monetary, he was not

22:07.688 --> 22:13.780
that old, but he, but then I made, he tried to help other people to survive.

22:13.780 --> 22:15.830
What did he do?

22:15.830 --> 22:18.120
He was, like I mentioned, he had a leather factory.

22:18.120 --> 22:18.120
Yes, he was

22:18.120 --> 22:18.570
Yes

22:18.570 --> 22:18.990
the owner, yes

22:18.990 --> 22:24.306
Leather factory and eh, we managed a little better than the other people.

22:24.306 --> 22:29.694
We were not, we are not rich, but we were, we were, we, we were eh, we had

22:29.694 --> 22:34.210
a little better, be, better eh financial ex, better existence.

22:34.210 --> 22:38.010
Did you expect to study, eh, like Simcha?

22:38.010 --> 22:46.263
Well, I, most our, our children and my, my, most of the family when, when, when we, when we graduated

22:46.263 --> 22:54.271
eh public school, we went to big city, to a bigger city to Warsaw, to study and to get jobs. I was

22:54.271 --> 23:02.035
yet too young, I was very young. I didn't even, I didn't even finish the school, the public

23:02.035 --> 23:09.880
school and during the war my father made sure that I, that I get private lessons, which is in my

23:09.880 --> 23:18.215
book. Private lessons from a tutor. Eh, and eh and eh religious le, religious and and general lessons.

23:18.215 --> 23:26.468
You know? And he w, he was very concerned that you should have education. Education was my parent's

23:26.468 --> 23:34.395
paramount. So as, eh, if the war wasn't be broke out, I would have go probably to, to over, to,

23:34.395 --> 23:42.322
to Warsaw, so this is my, my sisters went to Warsaw already and she start to, to work and to, and

23:42.322 --> 23:46.979
to make money to go to, to continue to, to studies. So eh

23:46.980 --> 23:49.870
Did she remain in Warsaw eh

23:49.870 --> 23:57.912
He remained in Warsaw, my sister, eh, my, one of my sisters, Broncia, remained in Warsaw with my two

23:57.912 --> 24:06.035
brothers. Simcha and Jacob. I had two brothers, one brother died eh about three years ago in Israël.

24:06.035 --> 24:14.158
He, he escaped to Russia eh in 1939 and he came back from Russia, he was electrical engineer. And the

24:14.158 --> 24:22.040
reason that he survived, that he didn't, he didn't eh signed up to go back. To Poland. Many of

24:22.040 --> 24:30.887
them were back to Po, signed to go back and they send them to Siberia. But he was working in a, astronomically

24:30.887 --> 24:39.091
institute in Moscow and when the, when the Germans got close to Moscow, they, they evacuated the, the,

24:39.091 --> 24:44.480
the institute to Jambo. To this is eh, Jambo I think is Kazakhstan.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.100
Ja

24:45.100 --> 24:52.404
And he survived, and right eh after the war, he s, he sends a letter to the, to the, to the

24:52.404 --> 24:59.950
gmina, to the, to the, to the, to the City Hall in Izbica to find out if anybody is alive from

24:59.950 --> 25:07.254
my family. So we answered him and we were living in that time in ZamoÅ›Ä‡. And he came, he,

25:07.254 --> 25:14.960
he got married, he came back to ZamoÅ›Ä‡, we to the station, he wouldn't recognize me. Because

25:14.960 --> 25:20.660
when he left I was a little boy, now I were already grown up, you know.

25:20.660 --> 25:29.150
But you said he didn't opt to go back, okay, that was in 1940, no, I try to understand

25:29.150 --> 25:29.150
19, 193

25:29.150 --> 25:29.850
the fast story

25:29.850 --> 25:35.310
1940, so he was there till 19, in Russia, till 1944. We were liberated in 1944

25:35.310 --> 25:35.600
Sure

25:35.600 --> 25:44.750
by Ru, the Russians. And eh, so, coming back, now, to they, they took us to Sobibor, they stopped

25:44.750 --> 25:53.901
in Travnika, they would not accept us, we went to Sobibor, we, so we knew this is, I knew this is

25:53.901 --> 26:03.335
our last destination. This is a deathcamp. I came to Sobibor with my brother Simcha, two sisters and

26:03.335 --> 26:13.052
a niece. My brother Simcha grabbed my hand and he went over to the Gestapo, he said he's a pharmacist

26:13.052 --> 26:22.203
and I'm his assistant. So they gave their approval and they stond, told us to wait in the side,

26:22.203 --> 26:31.353
with other trades people. They asked for professionals and trades people and there were among us.

26:31.353 --> 26:40.504
So eh we said goodbye to our sisters, to our niece, even my eight year old niece came over to hug

26:40.504 --> 26:50.032
me. She knew that, that she's going to die. The next day a, a neighbor of our town told Simcha that

26:50.032 --> 26:59.183
he cut the hair of my, of my sis, our sister Broncia. And she asked him how long it will take the

26:59.183 --> 27:08.711
gas to kill us. He could not answer her because he was surrounded with the Germans, he could not talk

27:08.711 --> 27:18.334
to them and when he told and I find out, I, I was figuring how, how, how, how bad they felt, the agony

27:18.334 --> 27:27.673
they had to go through, you know, they knew they are going to die. But eh, I knew I came to Sobibor

27:27.673 --> 27:37.107
I knew that, that this is the last destination, I would not survive Sobibor. But in the same talking

27:37.107 --> 27:46.258
I was, I was a teenager and I wanted to live. So so mine, mine, my mind is maybe there would be a

27:46.258 --> 27:56.352
miracle, maybe I will survive and to be able to take revenge. You know? And eh, I was working on different,

27:56.352 --> 28:05.786
different jobs. I even was cutting the hair of woman from Holland and they asked me not to cut their

28:05.786 --> 28:09.560
hair too short. They still till the last

28:09.560 --> 28:09.560
Terrible

28:09.560 --> 28:09.560
ti, till

28:09.560 --> 28:10.080
I can imagine

28:10.080 --> 28:23.070
still to the last moment they did not realize that this is the end.

28:23.070 --> 28:23.450
But your nie, your sister knew?

28:23.450 --> 28:23.450
Huh?

28:23.450 --> 28:26.920
Your sister realized she was going to be killed?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.210
My, my sister, sure, she, they, they knew it

28:28.210 --> 28:28.410
And

28:28.410 --> 28:34.923
but, but from Holland, from Holland, the transport came from Holland and eh I,

28:34.923 --> 28:41.270
I, I helped them with the baggage and they, they, and they offered me a tip.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.150
That was you, yes?

28:42.150 --> 28:51.020
My heart was bleeding. I knew the truth. That in a half an hour they will be reduced to ashes.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.980
Did you know it happened by gas?

28:52.980 --> 28:57.090
Did you know how they were killed?

28:57.090 --> 29:00.290
Yeah, they, I knew that they are going to be gassed, every

29:00.290 --> 29:00.290
You knew?

29:00.290 --> 29:07.315
every, every day was a transport they gassed and you, and you couldn't see, they all,

29:07.315 --> 29:14.664
they, they from, from, from, from the burning eh eh from the bur, from the ashes, you know?

29:14.664 --> 29:21.689
It's, it's eh eh, it's eh, I knew, but they did not realize till the last minute.

29:21.689 --> 29:29.119
When they told them to to leave their purses, they started maybe to have, realize something,

29:29.119 --> 29:36.225
something wrong, because they have their medicines, they have their, their, their money,

29:36.225 --> 29:42.039
their pictures, they didn't, they did not, didn't want to, to, to eh

29:42.040 --> 29:42.290
Separate

29:42.290 --> 29:51.476
separate from them. So eh, they bea, were beating, there, they were beated them and they, they, they

29:51.476 --> 30:00.846
had to leave everything. Then they went to a courtyard and eh and one of the Gestapo personal officers

30:00.846 --> 30:10.032
gave a little lecture. In eh, in, like a, in a satanic way. He said they had them, I welcome you and

30:10.032 --> 30:19.218
eh I a, I apologize for the, for the g, inconvenience in travel, that you, that you, that you cannot

30:19.218 --> 30:28.772
go to the living quarters to relax right away. But because of the typhus you had, had to be disinfected.

30:28.772 --> 30:38.050
So, but before you undress, I strongly recommend that you send home postcards to your dear ones. That

30:38.050 --> 30:47.053
you are in a nice place, in a resettlement place. They were clapping and, and some of them eh they

30:47.053 --> 30:56.239
were, were screaming 'bravo'! They did not realize till the last minute. And then when they went

30:56.239 --> 31:05.517
to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, way to the, to the third camp, the gas chambers, was a kiosk,

31:05.517 --> 31:14.887
they took watches and jewelry and they gave them fictitious number receipts, eh, that, that, when they

31:14.887 --> 31:24.258
returned they would get it back. So it was, they, they, they, they, they worked the examinations, they

31:24.258 --> 31:28.300
did it with precision, everything, you know.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.020
Yes, they did

31:30.020 --> 31:38.320
And eh, but I worked in different places, I worked  sorting, and many jewels, there was a big

31:38.320 --> 31:46.710
safe, I had to throw everything to all the jewels. But 99% of the jewels I wanted to have, eh,

31:46.710 --> 31:55.368
I did not want to help the Nazi war machine. So 99% I throw into the toilets. Around every times,

31:55.368 --> 32:03.936
you throw in the toilet this, this gave me some satisfaction. I knew I'm not going to survive,

32:03.936 --> 32:10.720
at least I got satisfaction that I, this is like I sabotaged them. You know?

32:10.720 --> 32:21.880
Simcha told me you stayed very close to him.

32:21.880 --> 32:31.280
Yeah. We, we were very close. You know, Simcha, you know eh Simcha were a, when eh before the

32:31.280 --> 32:40.681
uprising, a day before Simcha gave me a bottle of cyanide poison and a compass. In case I get

32:40.681 --> 32:49.981
injured on the on the, on the up, on the revolt, I should commit suicide because they buried

32:49.981 --> 32:59.281
people alive, if I survive the compass would show me how to go east. So, I'm dropping back

32:59.281 --> 33:07.570
and forth, but you are going to, you are going to eh eh edit it and everything (?)

33:07.570 --> 33:08.330
No, it's wonderful what you are telling, it completely makes sense

33:08.330 --> 33:15.160
The, the uprising in Sobibor will go in, in the annals in history. It's

33:15.580 --> 33:16.320
Would you

33:16.320 --> 33:25.787
one of the most successful uprising in World War II. And Sobibor, we put Sobibor on the map. Nobody

33:25.787 --> 33:35.160
knew about Sobibor. Because Sobibor was a top secret camp. Surrounded by barbed wire, watch towers

33:35.160 --> 33:44.627
with Ukrainian machine guns, though, this was the only camp which was mined all around. So Sobibor,

33:44.627 --> 33:53.713
there was no way anybody can go out of of Sobibor. But our aim was that maybe, maybe one person

33:53.713 --> 34:02.989
should get out from Sobibor and tell the world what happened here. Because Sobibor, we knew about

34:02.989 --> 34:09.780
Belzec, Treblinka, Dachau, Buchenwald, Majdanek, Sobibor was not known.

34:09.780 --> 34:10.170
I know

34:10.170 --> 34:16.100
And Sobibor was the most secretive camp. So

34:16.290 --> 34:23.740
When you say you, you cut hairs, if I may interrupt you, have you ever been in camp III? In where?

34:23.740 --> 34:24.540
In camp III?

34:24.540 --> 34:27.230
No, I was not, I was very close to camp III.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.430
But you never were in

34:28.430 --> 34:31.139
If I would go too close I couldn't go back. You know. We were in camp II and

34:31.139 --> 34:33.780
I. So we couldn't, we, we, we, we didn't have any contact with camp III.

34:33.780 --> 34:37.510
Camp III was the gas chambers?

34:37.510 --> 34:45.533
Camp III was the deathcamp and we, when I cut the hair, I was only maybe ten, fifteen feet away

34:45.533 --> 34:53.050
from the, from the, eh, from the, from the go, to the gas chambers and to the third camp.

34:53.050 --> 34:58.550
Did you have to work very hard? Or was it soso

34:58.550 --> 35:06.210
I worked very hard and, and, and, and, and eh, and the, I was beating, I was whipped.

35:06.210 --> 35:06.670
You were

35:06.670 --> 35:14.548
Yes eh from, from Frenzel and eh I eh, and Wagner, there is a lot of stories about Wagner, about

35:14.548 --> 35:22.673
Frenzel that's, which is, it's very eh difficult to go through the experiences because if I eh,

35:22.673 --> 35:30.551
once a transport came from the BiaÅ‚ystok area and the transport was eh, on the way for two, two

35:30.551 --> 35:38.840
weeks maybe and it was on a Sunday and they took me with another young boys to help unload the train.

35:38.840 --> 35:46.801
And then I opened the door, and I saw the scenery, I, I couldn't, I couldn't eh, I couldn't

35:46.801 --> 35:54.925
go through this things. People were weighing eh maybe a few hundred, tones, falling out decomposed,

35:54.925 --> 36:03.378
bodies, babies are weighting maybe a hundred pounds and when, when they told us to take out the bodies,

36:03.378 --> 36:11.667
when I started to grab a woman, to, to pull out the, the, the skin remained in my hands. So I decided

36:11.667 --> 36:19.874
I, I lay down on the floor, I figured I'm, I'm going to die here anyway, why should I go through

36:19.874 --> 36:27.999
those, those terrible experiences, I wanted to be shot. Frenzel came over, I testified in court in,

36:27.999 --> 36:36.041
in Hagen, about this episode. He came over, he beat me up, he told me to back to work. And he made

36:36.041 --> 36:44.248
a picture and he said what a wonderful Bild this is. And that woman with the baby was laying on her,

36:44.248 --> 36:52.291
w, on, on, on her tum. It's eh, I still have nightmares about that episode. So eh this is one of

36:52.291 --> 37:00.333
the episodes to go through with Sobibor what I went through, but I wanted to live, maybe will take

37:00.333 --> 37:02.959
the revenge, if we do something.

37:02.960 --> 37:11.010
Can I ask you another question? When your brother decided to go to Russia, eh, in '39 or in '40

37:11.010 --> 37:11.010
Yes?

37:11.190 --> 37:15.960
did you have a chance to make that kind of decision, or you didn't consider to go east

37:15.960 --> 37:15.960
Me?

37:15.960 --> 37:15.960
yes

37:15.960 --> 37:15.960
I was too young.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.340
Okay.

37:16.340 --> 37:23.255
I was too young, I was a young boy, I was going to school. If I was a year older, like eh, then,

37:23.255 --> 37:29.883
I would go to Warsaw too, like all my family. Most often the people that got the, after they

37:29.883 --> 37:36.799
finished public school, they went to study in Warsaw and to, to, but eh, but I, I was too young.

37:36.799 --> 37:42.130
And one of my sisters was too young. One sister went already. Two brothers

37:42.130 --> 37:43.560
To Warsaw?

37:43.560 --> 37:43.960
one sister

37:43.960 --> 37:44.150
But

37:44.150 --> 37:48.947
two, two brothers, one sister were already in Warsaw. But I'm, was still with one of

37:48.947 --> 37:53.690
my sisters, was still in, in, du, eh, during the war, we were still in, in eh Izbica.

37:53.690 --> 37:56.660
No, but I'm talking about your brother who went east.

37:56.660 --> 38:02.540
My brother was in, eh, in, he went to Warsaw too and he, he became electric engineer.

38:02.540 --> 38:06.060
Yes, but he also went to the Soviet Union, didn't he?

38:06.060 --> 38:10.834
He went to the, this brother, Jacob, he went to the Sovjet Union.

38:10.834 --> 38:14.580
This is, only, the, two brothers, Simcha and Jacob.

38:14.580 --> 38:14.580
Yes, sure

38:14.580 --> 38:22.264
This brother went to, to Russia and I remained with Simcha with the two sisters, in Izbica. So eh

38:22.264 --> 38:30.345
then they came to Izbica from Warsaw, they ca, when, when the war ended, 1939 for, they came to Izbica

38:30.345 --> 38:37.079
and we were together. So Simcha started to work in the hospital, in the medical field

38:37.080 --> 38:47.642
Mine, family was not eh, we are not only were eh, were eh worked in the, in the, in, in the leather,

38:47.642 --> 38:58.311
leather producing. We also baked matzes from generation to generation. And eh not for mo, make money,

38:58.311 --> 39:08.451
but for the community. Whoever could afford, whoever couldn't afford, he didn't pay nothing.

39:08.451 --> 39:18.909
And eh I, and eh, I, when I was a little boy, my first job by the matzes, my mother used, my mother

39:18.909 --> 39:26.620
picked ten, twenty girls, beautiful girls to eh, to roll the, the matzes.

39:26.620 --> 39:27.120
Yes

39:27.120 --> 39:27.120
Yes

39:27.120 --> 39:28.880
it's a lot of work

39:28.880 --> 39:35.023
Twenty girls, and my job, my, as a young boy, my job was,

39:35.023 --> 39:40.090
the first job was to to measure the, the flour.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.850
Wait a second. It was your job to, to m (?)

39:43.850 --> 39:49.608
My first job was to measure the flour and to put it to

39:49.608 --> 39:54.940
one lady and then she made eh the dough, you know?

39:54.940 --> 39:54.940

40:06.261 --> 40:12.463
I put water to the, to, to, she made I put water in. This was eh, and the third

40:12.463 --> 40:17.410
job was one, to make holes, holes to the, the matzes, you know?

40:17.410 --> 40:20.990
You know, one of my very early memories is

40:20.990 --> 40:27.130
Yes and my fourth, my fourth job, my aim was the, the, to have a biggest, the biggest honour.

40:27.130 --> 40:27.320
[laughs[

40:27.320 --> 40:31.000
the accomplishment I should put the matzes in to the oven.

40:31.000 --> 40:31.440
SpSL [laughs]

40:31.440 --> 40:36.140
But I could not, the war broke out and I did not accomplish this.

40:36.140 --> 40:36.140
[laughs]

40:36.140 --> 40:41.470
You know? With my aim, you know? So this was the matzes.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.350
My first, one of my earliest

40:43.350 --> 40:44.100
Ma, matze, matze maker

40:44.100 --> 40:44.250
memories

40:44.250 --> 40:51.185
then in our house also we had a big oven, so, from most of the city people came

40:51.185 --> 40:57.770
to put in the oven, the Cholent, the Cholent for the, for the, for Shabbat.

40:59.680 --> 40:59.800
Sure.

40:59.800 --> 41:05.198
And, and when they came back from the, from the services, from the Shul,

41:05.198 --> 41:10.596
they picked up the, the Cholent. You know? And eh, so it's eh, this is

41:10.596 --> 41:15.320
memories, historical memories, what happened eh before the war.

41:15.500 --> 41:23.210
Did it, did it happen because you had a big fire in the, in the factory, because eh, I can imagine

41:23.210 --> 41:27.800
No, we, we made, the special, the, was a big oven and we, we made the

41:27.800 --> 41:28.770
You make it specially

41:28.770 --> 41:35.400
we made, we made it specially, we, we, we, we heated up the oven, it should be hot

41:35.720 --> 41:35.880
Ja?

41:35.880 --> 41:41.579
and then the flavor was going around with every time we put in and, and, and they,

41:41.579 --> 41:47.417
and put the matzes in. And, and eh, and to each, the first, the first matzes we made

41:47.417 --> 41:52.699
for more, eh the first oven was for more prestigious for prestigious people.

41:52.700 --> 41:53.170
Ja?

41:53.170 --> 42:00.288
For the matzes, you know. This is the first, the first oven. The first, the first eh, and then we had

42:00.288 --> 42:07.759
a, eh, eh, in, in a, a big sheet with, with the, with, with, with a big thing and two people were carrying

42:07.759 --> 42:13.610
the matzes home. You know? This was the, this was the old fashioned transportation.

42:13.610 --> 42:13.610
Sure

42:13.610 --> 42:13.610
Yes. Yes?

42:13.610 --> 42:13.610
Fantastic

42:13.610 --> 42:21.277
You, you know what I mean, it's eh, it's, it's like a big sheet and the matzes,

42:21.277 --> 42:28.675
they put in the matzes inside and with, with a big eh and two people were carrying

42:28.675 --> 42:35.080
the matzes home. Every, every, every hour, every two hours was a, was a

42:35.230 --> 42:35.490
A new load

42:35.490 --> 42:43.432
Yes. And, and, and, and the war, the, we didn't have any, any eh new, a new system how to get water,

42:43.432 --> 42:51.140
so the water had to go from, we had to get from the wells. So we were carrying water from, from the

42:51.140 --> 42:58.771
well, from the wells with, with two, with two pails you know, like getting the water to the, to be

42:58.771 --> 43:06.401
able to, to, to, to make the, the, the matzes. Before the, before the, a day before the Pesach the

43:06.401 --> 43:14.187
rabbi came with a, with a group of Chassidic people in to eh check the kosher that eh we, everything

43:14.187 --> 43:22.052
should be eh, should be, everything should be in order. Everything should be eh made properly. It's

43:22.052 --> 43:29.682
like eh, it's like eh, an commission, you know, like a, like a eh health department, came to, to

43:29.682 --> 43:37.391
see if everything is okay. I remember a thing, I remember an episode that my mother once opened my,

43:37.391 --> 43:45.099
it is in my book, and my mother opened one chicken and she saw something, something is wrong, they,

43:45.099 --> 43:52.730
they had an ulcer there some place in the chicken, in the chicken. So she took, she send me to the

43:52.730 --> 44:00.827
rabbi to check it out. The rabbi was like a doctor. I came to the rabbi, he took the chicken and fifteen

44:00.827 --> 44:08.536
minutes he examined it like, like, like, like, like an internist. And after fifteen minutes he came

44:08.536 --> 44:16.478
over, he say, he took my chick, Fishele like this, go home, tell your mother she can cook the chicken.

44:16.478 --> 44:24.108
So this is a, little stories, you know, which eh, which is very, very important. That's why that

44:24.108 --> 44:32.050
professor in Warsaw, he was telling the students, you know, about the, historical things, small little

44:32.050 --> 44:39.759
things, they don't, the young people they don't know eh, all those things, you know. So this is

44:39.759 --> 44:47.389
a, and eh so this was eh, also in, in our house eh, eh, bypassing rabbi's when they went to city

44:47.389 --> 44:55.409
to city, they stayed in our house. You know? And eh and eh we discussed the future, we know the Germans

44:55.409 --> 44:58.680
already, we heard on the radio what's eh

44:58.680 --> 44:58.970
You knew

44:58.970 --> 45:07.591
Hit, Hitler, what he speaks about the, the Kristallnacht and this, and we talked to the rabbi he, the

45:07.591 --> 45:16.213
rabbi said that we, we will have miracles like, like from Egypt. They would, will take us out and we,

45:16.213 --> 45:25.005
we sur, we survive. I couldn't, I couldn't eh I couldn't eh I couldn't say to the rabbi because

45:25.005 --> 45:33.712
he was a rabbi and I - young boy, I knew eh, not by miracles, I know that they are miracles, there are

45:33.712 --> 45:42.761
not going to come miracles, miracles you heard, you heard about Korah in Israël, we had Samson eh [?Delaj

45:42.761 --> 45:51.468
Samson, you have big people, they didn't wait till till, for they, they took their own eh, their own

45:51.468 --> 45:59.919
eh, their hands, their own future of the hands. Like the Maccabees, you know? So I, I couldn't eh

45:59.919 --> 46:08.626
go against the rabbi to (?), he was but, but he he said we will, we will see, we survived, we survived

46:08.626 --> 46:14.259
on the, the Egypts and we survive now too, it should be a miracle.

46:14.260 --> 46:19.380
Did you know about the Warsaw uprising?

46:19.380 --> 46:22.090
No the Warsaw uprising

46:22.230 --> 46:22.630
The ghetto

46:22.630 --> 46:22.630
when they

46:22.630 --> 46:23.090
I'm talking

46:23.090 --> 46:29.280
they, they took, when the Warsaw uprising took place, we knew and the, the

46:29.280 --> 46:29.440
How?

46:29.440 --> 46:34.870
they liquidated, I mentioned, the, then they liquidated all the ghetto's

46:34.870 --> 46:37.250
Yes, sure, but how did you continue?

46:37.250 --> 46:41.380
The, our, our eh, uprising in Sobibor, eh, was eh second in scope after the Warsaw ghetto

46:41.380 --> 46:41.580
Yes

46:41.580 --> 46:41.730
Sobibor

46:41.730 --> 46:42.680
Yes but

46:42.810 --> 46:45.250
they come from the camps. You know?

46:45.250 --> 46:45.580
Yes, I know

46:45.580 --> 46:45.580
Se

46:45.580 --> 46:46.150
I know

46:46.150 --> 46:46.990
second in scope

46:46.990 --> 46:51.720
But I was wondering how did you know about the Warsaw uprising?

46:51.720 --> 46:53.350
We heard people, Polish people told us.

46:53.350 --> 46:53.350
Aha

46:53.350 --> 46:55.520
You know, we, we, we, we had

46:55.520 --> 46:57.710
They came through Izbica

46:57.710 --> 47:04.580
Yes, because people, some eh, one policeman told my brother, you know. We knew, we knew.

47:05.320 --> 47:10.460
When did you see the Germans coming? Did you see, can you remember when you saw them the first time?

47:10.460 --> 47:17.531
The Germans came, they were marching in 1939 they went into Izbica, they were marching, they

47:17.531 --> 47:24.450
were singing, German military songs, nicely dressed up, I was I was shaking, you know, and

47:24.450 --> 47:26.660
You were in the street?

47:26.660 --> 47:26.880
Huh?

47:26.880 --> 47:27.760
You were in the street?

47:27.760 --> 47:32.354
Yes, in the beginning, in the beginning here you know, they didn't eh, right

47:32.354 --> 47:36.948
away they didn't make eh the, the prosecution right away, they took a little

47:36.948 --> 47:41.130
while. Till they cut my, my, my, my, my father's beard, they cut off.

47:41.130 --> 47:42.200
They did?

47:42.200 --> 47:51.466
They cut off my father's beard, he came, he came home one day without a beard. You know. He said

47:51.466 --> 48:00.732
they caught him in, in the street and then they cut the h, the Wehrmacht. They, they cut his beard

48:00.732 --> 48:10.283
and many other eh Chassidish people from Izbica. So eh, it started little by little till ti, till the

48:10.283 --> 48:19.927
till the, they, they started to, really to send the people to the extermination camps. But eh Sobibor,

48:19.927 --> 48:29.477
the uprising in Sobibor, this is very important. The uprising in Sobibor wa, wa, the architect of the

48:29.477 --> 48:38.839
uprising was Leon Feldhendler. He, he made a plan. With the, he made a plan with precision. But and

48:38.839 --> 48:48.200
I was with, with my brother, Simcha, we were in the forty organizers. And eh I had to swear, swear,

48:48.200 --> 48:57.655
my brother took me in, I had to swear that I would not re, I would not reveal eh secrets, because we

48:57.655 --> 49:07.205
were afraid only, eh, other, they shouldn't come, they shouldn't find out. I, I had to swear that

49:07.205 --> 49:16.566
I will keep my secret, (?) But we didn't have any military knowhow, how to execute the plan. So a

49:16.566 --> 49:25.927
miracle came, that a transport came and this transport had many Russian Jewish POW's. And they eh

49:25.927 --> 49:35.478
took out eighty people to help us to help us with the, with the work on the, on the trans, transports

49:35.478 --> 49:45.028
in the, in, in, in the camp. So this was a this, this was a fatal mistake from the Germans. We needed

49:45.028 --> 49:54.389
we needed people with eh, with military experience. Because we were Jews, we never fought, we never

49:54.389 --> 50:04.412
had any weapons in our hands. And this is the people, they will help us in the revolt. So Leon Feldhendler

50:04.412 --> 50:13.962
got in contact with with a, with one of the, the lieutenant, Sasha Pechersky and he was eh, he became

50:13.962 --> 50:23.323
the military leader of the camp, because he had his own group of people and there was three, three,

50:23.323 --> 50:33.346
three people to, to a group and eh, and I was assigned to be a messenger. One of the other few messengers,

50:33.346 --> 50:42.801
I was a messenger that had to call in, call in the Germans to the, to the places that they find some

50:42.801 --> 50:52.352
nice leather coats, boots that they should come to try it on. When they came in with axes and knifes,

50:52.352 --> 51:01.713
we killed them and we took away their weapons. One was a Germans Wolf, when, when he went in to try

51:01.713 --> 51:11.263
on and I was outside, I was waiting a few minutes, I wanted to see the results, what happened. I went

51:11.263 --> 51:20.624
in to that eh warehouse, I saw, I saw Wolf laying on the floor, all blood around and my brother and

51:20.624 --> 51:29.890
eh one of the, one of the Russian POW's were dragging him in to hide him in between the clothes.

51:29.890 --> 51:38.779
I felt, I was shocking, I, I felt eh satisfaction and I said to myself this is for my family.-

51:38.590 --> 51:39.340
Sure.

51:39.340 --> 51:49.814
This is for the 250,000 of our brothers and sisters who perished in Sobibor. At least whatever will

51:49.814 --> 52:00.924
happen, at least I had the satisfaction that we took revenge. And we we were, we, we, we cut electricity,

52:00.924 --> 52:11.504
telephone so they shouldn't have, the German shouldn't have any communications with eh, with the

52:11.504 --> 52:22.296
garrison in Lublin. So eh, so we, we killed eleven in the same way. We killed eleven Germans and a few

52:22.296 --> 52:31.290
Ukrainian, Ukrainian. And we came, we, we, we got together in the appeal together and

52:31.290 --> 52:31.810
Appelplatz, yes

52:31.810 --> 52:43.703
op appel, and eh most of them don't know yet what happened. You know, only, only the, the, the conspirators

52:43.703 --> 52:54.397
knew about what, what's going on. So Sasha and Leon went on the table and they made a statement.

52:54.397 --> 53:05.527
They said brothers, our destiny has come. Let us rise and destroy this place. We have nothing to lose.

53:05.527 --> 53:16.766
At least we will fight with honor. It's better to die by bullet than die by, by gas. But, if somebody

53:16.766 --> 53:27.569
should survive bare witness and tell the world what happened here. So, we started to run to the, to

53:27.569 --> 53:34.880
the barbed wire my finger, I still have the scar, my finger was cut

53:34.880 --> 53:34.880
I see

53:34.880 --> 53:42.478
I still have the scar and, what he killed, we had to, we had to, after the barbed wires, we had

53:42.478 --> 53:50.556
to go through the mine fields. So and the, the mine field started to explode, it's like Stalingrad.

53:50.556 --> 53:57.995
So it came to my mind maybe I should run in the direction where they have their, where the SS

53:57.995 --> 54:05.433
has their, their building erected. Their living quarters. I figured they are not going to put

54:05.433 --> 54:13.112
the mines near their buildings. So I was running in that di, and I think this was, this was mine

54:13.112 --> 54:20.710
eh luck, and my brother probably also was the same direction. And we went and we, and I eh, and

54:20.710 --> 54:25.669
I ran out in the woods and I met with, met up with my brother.

54:26.150 --> 54:26.540
By accident?

54:26.540 --> 54:26.650
So h

54:26.650 --> 54:28.500
Did you agree where to meet eh

54:28.500 --> 54:36.768
I had, no, I, by accident, I am eh, it was also a miracle. By accident eh I find my brother in the

54:36.768 --> 54:44.952
woods. So eh hundred and sixty eh was killed during the uprising, you know, the hundred and forty

54:44.952 --> 54:53.558
were executed later and three hundred escaped. But from the three hundred who escaped only forty eight

54:53.558 --> 55:00.730
survived. Because of the circumstances on the Polish countryside. You know the story.

55:00.730 --> 55:01.720
Let me

55:01.880 --> 55:06.810
Now we only eight survivors left. But eight.

55:06.810 --> 55:07.400
No, eleven. Eleven.

55:07.400 --> 55:16.637
Eleven? So eh, now I am only one of the few, few survivors left and, and I promised eh Sasha Pechersky

55:16.637 --> 55:25.603
that I will, I will eh tell the story with the, what he said in the last minute. If somebody should

55:25.603 --> 55:34.569
survive, bear witness. Here I am Sasha, a living witness to both the horror and triumph of history.

55:34.569 --> 55:44.078
And as long as I have breath in my longs I will continue to go around all over the world, to the museums,

55:44.078 --> 55:50.780
to schools, to churches and to tell the inspirational story about Sobibor.

55:50.780 --> 55:51.760
And right you are!

55:51.760 --> 55:51.760
Huh?

55:51.760 --> 55:52.020
You are very right.

55:52.020 --> 55:52.630
Yes, okay.

55:52.630 --> 56:01.610
Congratulations, you are very right! I want to ask you a question, Sasha, Simcha

56:01.610 --> 56:01.610
Yes

56:01.610 --> 56:06.000
told me that they tried to poison

56:06.000 --> 56:06.470
Oh, this is

56:06.470 --> 56:06.470
the SS; do you have

56:06.470 --> 56:06.710
This, this story

56:06.710 --> 56:06.950
the story, because

56:06.950 --> 56:07.110
in the book.

56:07.110 --> 56:07.110
he, he couldn't get it very clear.

56:07.110 --> 56:16.960
The story is in the book. The story is that eh, that he was working the pharmacy

56:16.960 --> 56:26.318
and he prepared poison for that eh, for somebody was working in the kitchen,

56:26.318 --> 56:33.829
to poison the the SS and also the, the Ukrainian kitchen too.

56:33.830 --> 56:34.440
Aha

56:34.440 --> 56:43.575
and eh there was one, yes, he Wagner came in and, when they find out no, this was, then, then then one

56:43.575 --> 56:52.531
girl was working in, in the kitchen, by the Ukrainian kitchen, and there was one Ukrainian which, he

56:52.531 --> 57:01.487
was eh he was very more liberal. And she wanted to save his life. She told him not to come in to eat

57:01.487 --> 57:10.444
it today. Yes. And he, he gave, he, he gave out the whole secret and they came to Simcha in the, in,

57:10.444 --> 57:19.400
in the pharmacy there and the Wagner and they beat him up, he ask him if he gave the poison. He said

57:19.400 --> 57:28.714
he didn't and every things he said is, is numbered, numbered, every things is, they hold, every things

57:28.714 --> 57:37.760
he has to be is signed out, it couldn't be from here. Only, it could be only from, from, from, the,

57:37.760 --> 57:46.985
from the baggage, somebody took it out. But then, eh, it was very, some miracle that the, the, the, the

57:46.985 --> 57:56.121
supervisor came in and he saw what's going on with Wagner so he was afraid maybe that, that if this,

57:56.121 --> 58:02.480
if, if Simcha did it, then, then he would be responsible too, you know?

58:02.480 --> 58:02.760
Sure, sure, sure

58:02.760 --> 58:10.499
He is a supervisor. So he protected Simcha, he said, he said it couldn't be from here.

58:10.499 --> 58:18.239
Every milligram of poison is being registered, every things is here (?) it couldn't be

58:18.239 --> 58:26.243
from here. And, and this manager, the Gestapo helped, helped Simcha not to be executed from

58:26.243 --> 58:32.840
Wagner. So this was the story is more of a, is more eh, (?) in my book. (?)

58:34.620 --> 58:35.690
Whom did they execute?

58:35.690 --> 58:35.690
Huh?

58:35.690 --> 58:37.230
Did they exe, execute others for this (?)

58:37.230 --> 58:42.338
They, they executed the, the, the, the over there the girl and the, and

58:42.338 --> 58:47.231
the eh, eh, the, there was, the people who work in the kitchen. Yes.

58:47.231 --> 58:51.620
So this was eh episode also that's very important you know.

58:51.620 --> 58:55.967
Can you tell me about the meetings you had with the

58:55.967 --> 59:00.230
group of forty men preparing the uprising? Did you

59:00.230 --> 59:00.420
Well in the group we

59:00.420 --> 59:00.420
meet often?

59:00.420 --> 59:06.349
we had, we had eh, we had eh meetings every couple of days. We had

59:06.349 --> 59:11.830

59:11.830 --> 59:12.380

59:12.380 --> 59:21.008
And we, we were eh how, eh, Feldhendler were, were outlined, outlined how the how the, the uprising

59:21.008 --> 59:29.462
should take place. And we had eh all input, we asked questions was, about who was, like you have,

59:29.462 --> 59:37.829

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:46.030
Had you any idea what you would do after the uprising?

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:52.420
Oh, this is a very good question. I was eh interviewed by the eh Entertainment Tonight, you know

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:52.420
Yes

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:58.880

Yes

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:08.362
Entertainment Tonight and, and this eh journalist asked me, Philip how did you manage to survive

01:01:08.362 --> 01:01:17.791
after the war. After the uprising. So I said it's a very good question, this was not the end of

01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:27.026
my journey. I still had to struggle another year. Till I got liberated by the Germans. I was in

01:01:27.026 --> 01:01:37.233
het Partizans and I was hiding with a, with a Catholic Jewish family, their name Mazurek. They sacrificed

01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:46.565
their life to keep me and my brother hidden in a barn in the farm. And after the war I made them

01:01:46.565 --> 01:01:56.092
Yad Vashem. I made them the medals. And eh I go every year there I go to the, the father is eh not

01:01:56.092 --> 01:02:05.521
alive and then I go to the cemetery, bring flowers and I pay respect, they, they really there was

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:11.840
not too many, but whoever did it they was like a heroism. Because

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.110
But

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.130
they could be killed.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:19.710
let us, let us go step by step. You went to the woods, you met your brother.

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:22.784
We went, I went to the woods with the, I met my brother,

01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:25.420
he went with the, we joined a Partizans, but the

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:25.420
How did you, how did

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:25.420
Parti

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:25.910
you meet them?

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:33.219
Partizan, we met the Partizans and we joined them, but we had to escape because we were in danger

01:02:33.219 --> 01:02:40.379
with the Partizans. Because they were more, they didn't, they didn't eh, they, they, we are

01:02:40.379 --> 01:02:47.689
afraid they are going to kill us. Because we are Jews, you know? So we escaped from the Partizans

01:02:47.689 --> 01:02:54.170
and we were going to eh, to our eh area and we find a place to hide on that eh family.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.810
But can you

01:02:54.810 --> 01:03:03.325
And after the war, after the war, you know, the first, the first day I came out on the the first

01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:11.574
day I came out eh on the street with my friend, the, the sun was eh shining, a policeman came

01:03:11.574 --> 01:03:19.735
over, he said, he asked for the documents Polish policeman. I explained him in Polish, eh, I

01:03:19.735 --> 01:03:27.806
said we, we don't have any documents, you know, we are Jews. We just eh, we are liberated

01:03:27.806 --> 01:03:35.878

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:44.571
old eh, the secret police, and he told them that we are spies. And they throw us into the basement

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:52.731
with all the criminals. I thought when I be liberated they'll take me on a, on a wagon and

01:03:52.731 --> 01:03:58.320
they to, take me city to city, here is a survivor from Sobibor.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:58.320

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:06.075

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:28.860
Hmhm

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:37.304
Everybody is telling their experiences how they went through eh at night, the Polaks passed

01:04:37.304 --> 01:04:45.656
by, they throw in a grenade. The grenade would go inside, we would be all killed, but only

01:04:45.656 --> 01:04:53.915
pieces went in, a woman got injured. So we were, we, we, we, we, we were, we were not, we

01:04:53.915 --> 01:05:00.690
were not eh, eh after the war already we, we were in danger to be killed.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.760
How did you get out of the prison?

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.090
The, what?

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:05.720
How did you get out of the prison?

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:11.913
Oh, the prison, mine eh, mine mine eh, somebody went to Lublin to the government and they told

01:05:11.913 --> 01:05:17.480
the whole story, you know, and they, they got and they took, they let us out. You know.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:17.480
Okay.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:25.956
And I escaped and I went to eh I went to eh, to Lublin, the, the, the, the, the Russian told us, in,

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:34.856
eh, eh, that we should concentrate in the big cities. You know. So we all be more safe in the big cities.

01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:43.247
But I didn't eh I didn't want to stay in Poland so when, it was 19 already, 1945, the beginning

01:05:43.247 --> 01:05:51.639
so, and so we, I went to Germany. To Berlin. It was eh, eh, DP camp. Schlachtensee. The name of the

01:05:51.639 --> 01:06:00.878
camp was Schlachtensee, it was eh, and I went there as a DP, as a Displaced Person. I stayed in Schlachtensee

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:09.439
and then I went to, to Heidenheim, near Stuttgart and over there, in Germany I went to school, I was,

01:06:09.439 --> 01:06:17.830
then a half a day I went to, to work with a German, eh, a dentist and I wanted to be a dentist. And

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:26.306
I started my work, and I, I, I, after two years I knew all the profession, eh, so my brother, one of

01:06:26.306 --> 01:06:34.783
my brothers was eh Jacob was eh, the leader of the, the camp, 3000 DP camp in Heidenheim. He gave me

01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:43.174
an apartment and I opened my office. Dental office. And I was working, I was a young boy, I had eh,

01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:51.820
made money, I had two motor cycles, I lived like a king. And I was going to go to Palestine that time,

01:06:51.820 --> 01:07:01.228
was no Israël yet. So my brothers went first, because they were Zionist, president of the Zionist organization

01:07:01.228 --> 01:07:09.705
and they send me a letter I should not come, because they are already in the army, they were already

01:07:09.705 --> 01:07:18.181
fighting with the Arabs, when I come to, when I will come to Palestine, they'll take me right into

01:07:18.181 --> 01:07:26.742
the army and nobody be left from Bialowicz family from two hundred people. So I should go to America.

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:35.218
So I registered to the Joint distribution. To America and they send me a contract to go to Columbus,

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:43.694
Ohio. So I came to Boston, and from Boston they shipped me to Columbus. In Columbus I was working as

01:07:43.694 --> 01:07:52.170
a dental technician, because I didn't have the, all the mine eh, finished yet. My dental eh and eh

01:07:52.170 --> 01:08:00.647
in Columbus, Ohio I couldn't eh I couldn't adjust myself. Because I didn't have any eh, any eh

01:08:00.647 --> 01:08:03.189
social life. I was a young boy

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:03.960
You were alone

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:12.024
Huh? So, so I, I had a job I bought a car, didn't have any money, I went into the bank, I was (?) they

01:08:12.024 --> 01:08:19.934
gave me a, they ga, they gave me a loan and I bought a new car for hun, thousand four hundred dollars.

01:08:19.934 --> 01:08:27.999
It was a brand new Chevrolet, I went to Canada and from Canada I came to New York and I met many friends

01:08:27.999 --> 01:08:36.141
and I decided to move to New York. I came back to Columbus, Ohio, I told the boss that I decided to move,

01:08:36.141 --> 01:08:44.361
he called me into the office, he said Philip you are like a member of our family, sooner or later you'll

01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:52.115
take over the whole operation. If you want more money, we give you more money, stay here, stay here.

01:08:52.115 --> 01:09:00.025
I said it's not the money, it's not, the adjustment, I cannot adjust myself. And eh he said, well,

01:09:00.025 --> 01:09:07.935
stay with us two weeks, you bring somebody in your place and eh, we pay for the transportation. If you

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:15.689
ever decide to come back, the door is open for you. It was very nice of them. I came to New York and

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:23.987
I eh decided that, at once I couldn't become a, a dentist, I switched to jewelry. I went to, to a jewelry

01:09:23.987 --> 01:09:31.897
factory and I told them I had five years experience. I didn't have five days. They said come one day

01:09:31.897 --> 01:09:39.961
and we'll try out. So a whole weekend I couldn't sleep. I said, what, what do I do? I told them five

01:09:39.961 --> 01:09:47.716
years. But one thing I knew how to solve that, because I made the teeth. So this is the other things

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:55.548
maybe I will catch up. One day I come, they gave me a box of jewelry, I didn't know where to start,

01:09:55.548 --> 01:10:03.535
beginning with. I struggled the whole day. Five o'clock I came into the office, I was shaking he took

01:10:03.535 --> 01:10:11.600
the all the jewelry, he, he, he checked it out, he says to me, Philip, it seems to me like you have only

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:19.432
three years experience, not five. I heard this, I was very happy, I said, well, I'm not adjusted to

01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:27.419
this place, I don't know where the chemicals are and I don't know where, what is what. He said this

01:10:27.419 --> 01:10:35.252
is enough for me, tomorrow you can come to start to work. I came the next day and after three months,

01:10:35.252 --> 01:10:43.161
not full three months, he made me manager of the place. So this is after the war, you know, things you

01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:44.479
know, over there.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:53.580
Thanks Philip. Can we go back to your escape? How did you meet the Partizans?

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.290
After I escaped?

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.530
Yes.

01:10:54.530 --> 01:11:01.296
I met the Partizans eh, they, eh, one eh the Polish family told us in the, if I go to this area,

01:11:01.296 --> 01:11:07.921
to the, those woods, forest, (?) Partizans, they are, and, and they'll, they'll, they'll

01:11:07.921 --> 01:11:13.490
take you in, because we had already weapons from the Germans that we took away.

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:15.790
And they wanted them

01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:23.643
And, yes, and, and, eh, we joined them and they took us, they, they send us on mission

01:11:23.643 --> 01:11:31.496
to, to, to mine the railroad tracks, to mine, for the transportation. And we did a lot

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:39.349
of things, but we, we overheard not good things, about anti-Semitism, that, that, they

01:11:39.349 --> 01:11:47.476
were not happy with us. So we we, we, we, we feared for our lives. So we, we, we managed,

01:11:47.476 --> 01:11:55.420
we, we decided to, to leave the Partizans. We escaped. And we escaped in all directions

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:01.630
to the village, where, where I came from. You know? And eh it's eh

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:05.870
Were you scared to be betrayed by the Polish peasants?

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:15.685
We were always afraid the Polish despite, you know, despite that I was saved by Polish family, but

01:12:15.685 --> 01:12:25.501
eh the, the situation in Poland was not, not conducive to, to the Jewish. They ha, they have, many

01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:35.618
of them collaborated with the Germans. Many Poles. When I speak in Poland in the universities I speak

01:12:35.618 --> 01:12:45.835
the good things and the bad things. You know? It does, does, many of them helped Jews and many of them

01:12:45.835 --> 01:12:56.151
collaborated with the German and took us to the Germans to be killed. So eh is eh and eh I, I'm under

01:12:56.151 --> 01:13:06.869
the impression that they, they made the, the death camps in Poland because they had their full cooperation.

01:13:06.869 --> 01:13:17.186
Because Poland was anti-Semitism was very strong in Poland. So eh but I have now, I have good relations

01:13:17.186 --> 01:13:27.302
with the Polish students, I speak in the universities in Krakau, Warsaw, now I am going to Gdansk and

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:37.418
WaÅ‚Ä™sa wants to meet me. I have good experience with the Polish young people and I, they learn from

01:13:37.418 --> 01:13:47.936
me and I learn from them. You know? That to, to build a better world, because in Sobibor we were fighting

01:13:47.936 --> 01:13:57.952
not only for our lives, we are fighting for a world without genocide. A world without anti-Semitism.

01:13:57.952 --> 01:14:08.168
But now we are building new Sobibors. In Africa, like in Darfour, hundreds of thousands of people were

01:14:08.168 --> 01:14:18.085
killed because of religion. And eh even, eh Iran is building nuclear bombs for the same reasons for

01:14:18.085 --> 01:14:21.090
the German build crematoriums.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:21.970
Yes

01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:31.852
So we have to be on guard for any manifestation of anti-Semitism and genocide and

01:14:31.852 --> 01:14:40.540
to be, to build a better world. This is, that's, that's why I, that's

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:40.540
Absolutely

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:48.868
why I go to places, I go all over the world and I speak and to, and to tell the story not,

01:14:48.868 --> 01:14:57.197
not all, not many of the survivors, they don't want to go to Poland, they don't want to

01:14:57.197 --> 01:15:05.802
speak about eh, about the, about their experiences in the, in the camps. It's very difficult

01:15:05.802 --> 01:15:14.040
to go, to go to remember the experiences. But I am on a different opinion. I disagree with

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:21.180
them. I think we have to learn, we have to teach the new generation. You know?

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:28.964
Absolutely. I'm still thinking about your escape, Philip. Which you touched very

01:15:28.964 --> 01:15:36.654
short in your wonderful story. Eh when you are talking about the good side of the

01:15:36.654 --> 01:15:44.344
Polish, there were Poles who did hide you and protected you. Eh, can you describe

01:15:44.344 --> 01:15:50.990
the situation when you were in hiding? Was it a cellar, was it a hole?

01:15:50.990 --> 01:16:00.409
Oh, the, the we were hiding, we, we had a, we had underground underground we had a place. Maybe twelve

01:16:00.409 --> 01:16:09.737
by twelve cubic meter and eh and they brought us they brought us food The food, they, they brought in

01:16:09.737 --> 01:16:19.895
a pail like, like they go for, to milk wo, like they want to milk eh for the cow so the neighbors shouldn't,

01:16:19.895 --> 01:16:29.130
shouldn't shouldn't notice something wrong. And at night we went out to exercises. You know. And

01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:38.458
also mine eh, the, the family, they were vo, they were very poor. So they didn't have any money, so

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:47.970
we, we wanted to give him, to help him. We had we had those, some gold pieces. From, we took, (?) I was

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:57.205
working with millions of dollars of jewelry, so Simcha told me to take something along. So eh so we,

01:16:57.205 --> 01:17:06.440
my, s, we made it s, so that he shouldn't, they shouldn't know that we have, we have jewelry. So

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:13.090
many often they, they, they killed the people, you know, many, many they

01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:13.230
For that reason

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:22.446
took him in, they took him in and they killed him. So I'm, I made it with my brother that he disappeared

01:17:22.446 --> 01:17:31.054
for the whole, for the whole day and night. You know? He was hiding in the in the barn. But he goes

01:17:31.054 --> 01:17:39.748
to the pharmacy in Izbica to get money. They owned the money. And then the bread, we, we, we brought

01:17:39.748 --> 01:17:48.704
the money, you know and they, and they and eh (?) he went just for, for a short time. just to exchange,

01:17:48.704 --> 01:17:57.225
exchange the, the, the, the gold for, for Polish money and we gave him the money, they shouldn't

01:17:57.225 --> 01:18:06.180
be, he shouldn't be eh he shouldn't have any eh doubt, that we have some jewelry, you know. Because

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.050
we were afraid too, despite they helped us. But you know

01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:11.760
You had to be careful

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.900
the jewelry, it's, it's eh magnetism, you know. So we had to be careful.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.190
But you trusted the pharma (?) cie

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:26.469
So it's, eh, no it's a very tempting, what I remember. When we were liberated for the, from, from

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:35.076
the, by the Russians we, we stopped eh, we stopped a Polish farmer with, it's in my book, and he should

01:18:35.076 --> 01:18:43.273
take us to ZamoÅ›Ä‡ and we, eh we put the, we put some stuff, our belongings, what we have, whatever

01:18:43.273 --> 01:18:51.553
we have, we went to get the rest of the, we came out, he disappeared. He ran away with the, with the,

01:18:51.553 --> 01:18:59.996
with the horses I think. So we went, we went down the, the, the road and the, the front was maybe about

01:18:59.996 --> 01:19:08.193
four, five kilometers away, was the, the, the the, the, the fighting (?) from the Germans so we, eh,

01:19:08.193 --> 01:19:16.308
the officer came out, a major, came out on the from the truck and he speaks to us Jewish. A Russian

01:19:16.308 --> 01:19:24.588
eh, a Jewish officer. So we tell him what hap, we told him what happened. They put away our stuff and

01:19:24.588 --> 01:19:32.867
he ran away. So he says go on the truck, we went on the truck, he made a U-turn, you know, those road

01:19:32.867 --> 01:19:41.228
they're almost, they almost over turned, and maybe by, by a couple of kilometers away, he caught the

01:19:41.228 --> 01:19:49.507
guy with the things. So first of all he went over them, he beat him up a little bit, he didn't shot

01:19:49.507 --> 01:19:57.951
them, and the told us like, he told us they're to, to, to, to, it was, was, was, was, was all covered

01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:06.312
with straw. He opened up (?) we opened up, there is a whole cow, in, in, in four parts, a leg, a whole

01:20:06.312 --> 01:20:14.509
cow. He was, he was taking the cow some place for sale. He said take the whole cow and put it on the

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:22.870
truck. You know? I was weighing 65 pounds and I, I have, I cannot, they, take eh a cow, the, I don't

01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:31.068
have any strength, you know (laughs) we, we, we struggled, we took the whole four parts from the cow

01:20:31.068 --> 01:20:39.347
and we put it on the truck, you know and our belongings, so he was, eh, so eh, and eh, so I was thin,

01:20:39.347 --> 01:20:47.462
eh thinking he was taking now to ZamoÅ›Ä‡. Where is he taking? He is taking us to the front, he has

01:20:47.462 --> 01:20:49.840
to deliver the, the supplies.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.380
Yes

01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:00.169
And the Katyushas (makes whistling sound), oh, we had survived Sobibor, here are, here I am on the

01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:05.444
front, you know, here I'm going to die, you know. For him it's nothing, we go, they go on the

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:10.719
fire, you know. We came to the, it's, it's like I, it's like, like Stalingrad, the fighting

01:21:10.719 --> 01:21:16.157
there. I figured I'm not going to come back here, I'm going to die here. Eh, we, we, now we have

01:21:16.157 --> 01:21:21.486
to unload everything, it was, it was a big effort to load it and unloaded the cow, it's hundreds

01:21:21.486 --> 01:21:26.925
of pounds. And after we unloaded, then they took us back to ZamoÅ›Ä‡. This is a episode right after,

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:31.330
after it's a good epis right after the war, you know. They took us to ZamoÅ›Ä‡.

01:21:31.330 --> 01:21:34.600
And in ZamoÅ›Ä‡, what happened in ZamoÅ›Ä‡?

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.680
Samozc, like I mentioned in the, they arrested me and they throw

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.070
That's in ZamoÅ›Ä‡

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:42.914
I, they throw in a grenade, you know. And I was living a little

01:21:42.914 --> 01:21:46.210
bit in ZamoÅ›Ä‡ then, we we went eh, we went to Berlin

01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:47.050
Went to Berlin

01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:52.241
to Lublin, to a big city and from there I went to eh, we stayed there, we living

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:56.590
in a little bit, but till, till I could manage to go to, to Berlin.

01:21:56.590 --> 01:22:07.520
I have another question. Did Simcha trust the pharmacist in Izbica when you were in hiding?

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:07.810
In Izbi

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:08.070
Yes

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.700
he was not

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:09.050
Sim, Simcha

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:10.020
he was not working in

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:10.510
Simcha is

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:14.180
in, during the, eh, he does not work in the pharmacy, he was

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.100
No, I'm, I'm asking you a different question, sorry

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:16.630
Yes, yes

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:21.500
You said eh you exchanged jewelry for money at the pharmacy

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.530
Oh, this, this is at, when we were hiding in

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:25.400
Yes

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.910
b, in the barn. With the Polish family

01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:27.490
Was that in Izbica?

01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:30.290
He went to, Izbica is only three kilometers away.

01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:30.960
okay

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.950
He walked, he walked to the Izbica, at night

01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:37.680
But he trusted the pharmacist?

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:37.680
Huh?

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.170
Did he trust

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:45.027
Did, yes, the pharmacy he trusted, he knew him because he sold them many times, gold, jewelry,

01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:51.447
gold eh pieces, yes, he, he trusted him because eh, he knew him well, you know. As a, as

01:22:51.447 --> 01:22:57.940
a pharmacist. And he, he, he told him to be careful what happened you know. So it's eh,

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:03.120
he was some Poles were okay, like I say, it's, eh, good and bad ones.

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:10.930
Like, like in any nationality, but in Poland was a little more. Poland has a history

01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:16.146
You came to New York, you got two children by your first wife,

01:23:16.146 --> 01:23:21.110
she passed away, you got three children by your second wife

01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.110
Yes

01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.520
Your daughter

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.727
I don't have to tell what happened to my, about the, my, this is what

01:23:25.727 --> 01:23:29.460
happened to my second wife. Maybe I had two wives, that's it.

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:29.460
Yes, of course

01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:37.330
First wife, and then, then we met and a second wife, it is eh

01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:37.330
And you separated

01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:37.330
Yes

01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:37.330
and

01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:39.060
we divorced, the second wife eh, so it is

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.640
And you are a single now and everybody likes you

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:51.147
I won't say everybody, it's, it's, it's a compliment my (?) just joking,

01:23:51.147 --> 01:23:59.230
comple, I eh I, I feel very good to be, to be surrounding with many friends.

01:23:59.230 --> 01:23:59.710
Sure

01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:03.610
You know? And I have flexibility.

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:10.860
Now, did you always work as a jeweler or as a management in jewelry, did you remain in it

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:18.210
Well, that I, like I mentioned before, mine job, I was in the dental line, dental

01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:19.210
Yes, you did

01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:23.580
and after the dental I switched to jewelry, you have my whole eh story about the jewelry I gave you

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:24.450
Absolutely

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:35.559
and then eh, after eh, I was working within the jewelry for a few years, I went eh in business

01:24:35.559 --> 01:24:44.710
for myself. Manufacturing jewelry. And then eh, and now now I'm busy lecturing.

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:45.600
Yes, sure

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:54.784
So now I have a fulltime jec, lecturing, but I still eh have contact in the jewelry business,

01:24:54.784 --> 01:25:04.462
if somebody needs something I still can get the good prices. Like half the price from eh whatever,

01:25:04.462 --> 01:25:13.843
whatever it is in the store. So it keeps me occupied between the jewelry and the lecturing. And

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:23.916
I try to educate the people, especial the new generation. You know. About my inspirational experiences

01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:33.199
and to, to build a new world. Because the world is still profoundly broken. And we have to fix

01:25:33.199 --> 01:25:42.383
it, but you don't know how to begin with. You know? It's eh, we have to Sobibor should be

01:25:42.383 --> 01:25:48.209
a lesson. For everybody. How we fought back, the injustice.

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:54.330
Can I ask you a question about your story: what happened to your father?

01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:55.750
My father

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.790
because your father is nowhere in your story

01:25:57.790 --> 01:26:04.234
My father, like I mentioned, he was, my father was very

01:26:04.234 --> 01:26:10.210
eh, very involved in the Jewish community in Izbica

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:11.660
Hmhm

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:25.520
because of eh, he also was a business, he was in the business very eh, eh anerkennt, anerkennt, (?)

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:25.860
Yes

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.120
you speak German too, huh?

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.630
Yes, sure

01:26:27.630 --> 01:26:36.846
And he, he was very liked in the business circles and eh, he tried to help people as best as

01:26:36.846 --> 01:26:46.164
possible, like I mentioned he gave money to buy food for the Shabbat, for, for, for, the, for

01:26:46.164 --> 01:26:54.780
the poor people and eh but he did not he refused to join the Judenrat. During the war.

01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:55.700
He was asked?

01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:05.283
Yes. He was active in Izbica but eh, did not, no, no, Judenrat he didn't want to join because

01:27:05.283 --> 01:27:14.867
he figured the Judenrat had to take orders from the Germans, so it's to, to to supply people,

01:27:14.867 --> 01:27:24.450
thousands of people to go the, to the camps, you know. He didn't want to take part in it. But

01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:33.731
he was taking, he, he was, he, he w, he was eh caught and they, and they took him in a train

01:27:33.731 --> 01:27:43.617
to Belzec. And before Belzec he escaped from the train from the windows and he came back to Izbica

01:27:43.617 --> 01:27:53.100
and the police, the Polish police caught him and they took him to to the Germans and, and then

01:27:53.100 --> 01:28:02.784
he went to the transport to, to Sobibor. So my father eh went to Sobibor too. My mother was shot

01:28:02.784 --> 01:28:12.771
in Izbica, my father went to Sobibor and my two sisters, my three sisters, and eh, two nie, nieces,

01:28:12.771 --> 01:28:22.052
eh a niece and a nephew, they all went to Sobibor, perished. And, and hundreds of members of

01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:31.434
the family (?) cousins, (?) so they all were perished so tragically. And eh sometimes, when I

01:28:31.434 --> 01:28:36.680
go to Sobibor, when I stand before the the ashes (?)

01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:38.230
The hill?

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:49.243
and I talk to myself, those people, which there perished, if they would be alive today, how much they

01:28:49.243 --> 01:29:00.039
could contribute to the world, in medicine in every aspects of life, it would be a better, a better

01:29:00.039 --> 01:29:10.616
place to live. And they all perished so tragically. And, and here I am being there as a teenager,

01:29:10.616 --> 01:29:21.521
I survived Sobibor, what made me to survive, but maybe because I had a, had a, God gave me a mission

01:29:21.521 --> 01:29:32.207
to teach the world. Because the the the the Holocaust was not done by God, the Holocaust was done

01:29:32.207 --> 01:29:42.785
by people. You have eh good people and evil people. So they got, they got the overhand, you know,

01:29:42.785 --> 01:29:51.400
the bad people. You know, the evil people and they, they created the Holocaust.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:56.720
Philip, you have been eh at many trials about Sobibor, you have been a witness in many cases

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:56.720
Oh

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:57.540

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.260
talk about that?

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:05.572
it's a good question. [scrapes throat] I came eh to a t,

01:30:05.572 --> 01:30:11.450
I was invited to a trial to Hagen, Germany, on Frenzel

01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.570

01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:12.440
Huh? Yes

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.460
When was it?

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:17.590
I think so '62. I think so. And I was

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.940
Was it '62 or '65?

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.550
I don't know exactly, but you, we can check it out.

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:23.490
We can check, yes.

01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:33.185
The the trial was an eh, I c, when I came to Hagen, when I came to a hotel, I had a note on my desk.

01:30:33.185 --> 01:30:42.589
And eh, and eh, the desk was say Mister Bialowicz my name is so and so and my husband's name is

01:30:52.187 --> 01:31:01.591
an architect or I don't remember exactly, I know, we are on the welcome committee, we know that

01:31:01.591 --> 01:31:10.995
you are going to go through a very a, very anics, eh, very, very, not good experiences during the

01:31:10.995 --> 01:31:20.787
trial. Unpleasant experiences during the trial, but we want to make you stay as pleasant as possible.

01:31:20.787 --> 01:31:30.676
Seven o'clock we are coming to pick you up to our house. To, for dinner. Exactly like Germans, seven

01:31:30.676 --> 01:31:37.560
o'clock they came exactly with their Mercedes, and they took me home.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.929
And the, the, the table was decorated with, with, with porcelain and crystal like,

01:31:40.929 --> 01:31:43.930
like I was being a, like, like, like I'll be a king, you know, the, the

01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:44.990
Or, or family member

01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.910
family member

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:47.150
I do this for family

01:31:47.150 --> 01:31:50.930
Yes, yes, yes.

01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:50.930
[laughs], sorry

01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:59.383
Then I saw artifacts, Jewish artifacts all around the wall. So I asked them what is this? She

01:31:59.383 --> 01:32:07.746
said to me I am a religious teacher and I collect artifacts. Religious artifacts. Okay. Then

01:32:07.746 --> 01:32:16.473
she said I'm going to invite my parents to meet such a very important guest here  So I figured

01:32:16.473 --> 01:32:23.200
her father will come and I will recognize him from Sobibor maybe. [laughs]

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.010
Okay, what happened?

01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:32.955
So twenty minutes they came in, the father hugs me, hugged me, you know, he takes out, and then his

01:32:32.955 --> 01:32:42.081
wife greeted me very nicely, he takes out the album and he shows me that he collects all the pictures

01:32:42.081 --> 01:32:50.846
form the Jewish community in Hagen. Hagen. And eh he wants to take me over, he is restoring this,

01:32:50.846 --> 01:32:59.792
the synagogue. He wants to show me how he's restoring the synagogue and I fi, I, I said to myself

01:32:59.792 --> 01:33:06.840
this is Germans, I thought all the Germans are like eh, like Wagner or Frenzel

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.520
No they are not

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:14.758
that this is Germans and Mister Bialowicz, tomorrow we have tickets on opera,

01:33:14.758 --> 01:33:21.620
to go. I was surprised you know? And they gave me a red carpet treatment.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:21.620
Aha

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:28.491
During my trial. And I went to the trial. The trial was packed with students,

01:33:28.491 --> 01:33:35.362
college students, university students, with eh, with high school students and

01:33:35.362 --> 01:33:42.412
the trial started and Frenzel, he took eh the lawyer, he, he, he hired the best

01:33:42.412 --> 01:33:48.569
lawyers because he had he had so much gold, so much jewelries, he had

01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:49.560
He had enough money

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:57.781
money to hire the best lawyers. And the lawyer started to interrogate me like I was being

01:33:57.781 --> 01:34:06.280
on trial. I asked the judge you brought me over as a witness? And how, who is on trial here,

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:14.502
or this, or this eh or this eh murderer? And to the lawyer I said if you put on a uniform

01:34:14.502 --> 01:34:22.817
I might recognize you too. [laughs] He came over to, to, to me during the recess, he said,

01:34:22.817 --> 01:34:31.223
Mister Bialowicz, I am not a Nazi, I have Jewish friends. I said the gold, eh Waldheim, the

01:34:31.223 --> 01:34:38.060
general secretary of the United Nations also has Jewish friends. You know?

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:38.730
It was at that time

01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:39.490
And he was

01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:39.790
yes

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:46.340
he was eh big Nazi. And if you would speak to me, a survivor, a teenager, you have to speak to me

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:53.026
through silk and the judge told him to go easy with me. And I had to go through all the experiences

01:34:53.026 --> 01:34:59.779
and I had to tell the story about that transport where I, when I pulled the woman, her skin remained

01:34:59.779 --> 01:35:05.790
in my hands and I, and I couldn't continue, I got sick. The doctor came in to treat me.

01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.790
Wagner?

01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.790
The doctor.

01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.790
Yes, yes, yes

01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:07.590
The doctor, he came to treat me

01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:08.040
Yes

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:16.573
and the Schumanns came over to me and they hugged me and said Mister Bialowicz it's not

01:35:16.573 --> 01:35:25.395
our fault. This is all our grandparents, they are, we want to have a good relations with the

01:35:25.395 --> 01:35:34.121
Jews. So you have you have so you have Germans and the, they, they say all the Germans, are

01:35:34.121 --> 01:35:42.654
bad. I am of a different vision, I have said you have you have good Germans too. And the,

01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:50.230
the, the, the judge told me that his two daughters are in a kibbutz in Israël.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.050
That they are filled with Germans

01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:53.580
The, the judge. Huh?

01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.120
They are filled with Germans

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:54.780
At what?

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.440
The kibbutzim are filled with Germans

01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:02.096
Yes? He told me, I said you see, I, so eh you see you see a judge, they send

01:36:02.096 --> 01:36:07.977
their children to a kibbutz. So you can't judge that all the Germans, I think

01:36:07.977 --> 01:36:13.634
all they're murderers, they should be persecuted, they should, they should

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:18.770
get, they should get eh what they be, what belongs to them. So we can

01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:21.770
But what happened during the eh trial, I mean what was

01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:31.219
At the trial, the trial, I I brought that episode what happened with Frenzel, how I was beaten,

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:40.171
how, how he mistreated the, the prisoners, how he mistreated the people that came with the

01:36:40.171 --> 01:36:49.919
transports and eh and eh I had an episode that eh a friend of my was, was with my, in the barracks

01:36:49.919 --> 01:36:57.279
with me, we, we, he, he was, he was sleeping one, one bed below me. And he

01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:57.770
Frenzel?

01:36:57.770 --> 01:37:00.180
he, no, one of my f, friends

01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:01.220
Okay, okay, sorry

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:02.970
in the barracks where we, we used

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:04.650
sorry, I apologize, yes?

01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:09.615
by the, by the, by, eh, eh by our living quarters. And once he came out to that eh, to

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:14.639
that magazine where I was sorting the food. Whatever I opened the food, was al the gold

01:37:14.639 --> 01:37:18.970
with diamonds. That I had throw into the safe, like I mentioned, I throw in

01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:18.970
In the toilet, yes

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:28.020
most of it into the toilet. He came in, he was, name is Mordechai, I should give him some food. So I

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:36.891
gave him was, was the, the, the, from Holland, was the, this, the jars with, with butter, you know?

01:37:36.891 --> 01:37:46.030
With Holland I gave him, I gave him eh salami, I gave him eh different things a package, he walked out

01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:55.170
and I, maybe eh two blocks away Frenzel caught him with the package. And I saw through the window that

01:37:55.170 --> 01:38:04.220
he goes to, towards towards that magazine. So I figured he told him that I gave him this and he come,

01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:13.090
he is taking into eh, to eh, to show me who, who, who gave you this. So I so I grabbed some jewelry

01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:22.140
and I ran to the toilet. To hide, you know? And I w, and I was in the toilet there. And they eh, they

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:31.190
called my name. They called my name, I should immediately come to the so I figured this is the end of

01:38:31.190 --> 01:38:40.599
my life. But I wanted to live. So it's still in my instinct, I want to live. Why should I do it, should

01:38:40.599 --> 01:38:49.559
I throw my into the toilets, you know those pits, should I throw myself inside to the toilets or, or

01:38:49.559 --> 01:38:58.967
to go back and face the consequences. I, I decided to go back. I came back, all the workers were standing

01:38:58.967 --> 01:39:08.017
were standing in eh, lined up, and they're waiting for me. I figure they are waiting for me because

01:39:08.017 --> 01:39:16.977
he's going to tell them that I gave him this. I came over and Frenzel asked him. Who gave you this

01:39:16.977 --> 01:39:26.027
package? Here you have all the people here. Show them, show me who gave you this. So you know what he

01:39:26.027 --> 01:39:34.988
said? He said he took it himself. So he saved my life, he saved all this lives, this was, I consider

01:39:34.988 --> 01:39:44.127
this heroism. Because still today I pray for his soul. That he saved my life. And the, the judge asked

01:39:44.127 --> 01:39:53.267
me what happened to, to him? On the trial. I said he took him away, I heard a shot and eh half an hour

01:39:53.267 --> 01:40:02.496
later his clothing, this clothing, I saw it in his clothing. And, and, and, and then he said, and, and,

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:11.636
and at night he didn't sleep with me anymore. He was not there. So I gave fact I had to give hundred

01:40:11.636 --> 01:40:20.506
percent facts what he did. That he committed a crime. So that's why, my testimony, the judge said

01:40:20.506 --> 01:40:22.030
he was very makes

01:40:22.810 --> 01:40:23.260
moved

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:28.374
makes him give eh the, the life imprisonment. Because it was a very powerful

01:40:28.374 --> 01:40:33.623
testimony I gave. Powerful. And he got life imprisonment but he, then he, then

01:40:33.623 --> 01:40:38.200
he got in the, he got out, because of sickness of this, you know how

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:38.330
like it is

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:39.630
the

01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:39.630
like it is. Like it is.

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:46.500
So this is, this the trial eh

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.020
Were those hard periods, those

01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:48.760
Huh?

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:53.030
tri, so, such a trial, was it a hard period? Was it difficult for you?

01:40:53.080 --> 01:41:01.217
For me it was very difficult, I got sick in the, during the trial, they, the doctor had to treat

01:41:01.217 --> 01:41:09.100
me. Because it was very difficult for me to go through all the experiences I went though what

01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:16.983
I saw and especially when I was so young. And it had a very, very psychological effect on me.

01:41:16.983 --> 01:41:24.697
I told the judge I still have night, nightmares. I wake up in screaming. Especially on that

01:41:24.697 --> 01:41:30.970
transport. Other other episode we had with Wagner. You heard about Wagner?

01:41:30.970 --> 01:41:30.970
Yes, sure

01:41:30.970 --> 01:41:39.232
He was a bandit, eh he he, he, he needed satisfaction, something to happen, I should do something

01:41:39.232 --> 01:41:47.581
against the prisoners. He took me and eh couple of other boys to empty a well.  Just empty a well,

01:41:47.581 --> 01:41:55.929
just for nothing. And he throw in those pails on their head and the, the water came, came out with

01:41:55.929 --> 01:42:03.170
blood. We, wet, because he opened up our skulls. This was his satisfaction. You know.

01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:05.000
I don't understand completely

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.350
He took us to a well

01:42:06.810 --> 01:42:06.990
Yes?

01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:08.580
you know? To empty the well.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:08.580
Yes

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.870
The water, to empty, to empty it.

01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:10.120
Yes

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.000
And he was standing on the top and, and

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:14.690
And threw stones

01:42:14.690 --> 01:42:18.486
with, with, with another guy, with a Polish, with a Jew, and he was

01:42:18.486 --> 01:42:21.830
throwing in the, the empty pa, the empty pails, he threw in

01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.900
Okay

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:29.475
on their heads, so they should empty the, the, in the water, the water became like blood,

01:42:29.475 --> 01:42:36.540
red. This was his satisfaction. I te, I testified this in me, in the, at the trial.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:36.690
It was

01:42:36.690 --> 01:42:37.350
He was a

01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.520
personal

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:45.352
he was a very bestia, bestialski, be, be, bestial. And eh once he took me after the transport,

01:42:45.352 --> 01:42:53.435
when the transport came on the yard, people tried to hide to hide the jewelry, diamonds diamonds,

01:42:53.435 --> 01:43:01.268
gold pieces under the sand, it was all sand, and then he was, he was the smartest, the Wagner,

01:43:01.268 --> 01:43:09.184
smartest, intelligent and he knew this. That they were hi, probably were hiding the jewelry. He

01:43:09.184 --> 01:43:17.266
took me, he took me one time to with him, around four o'clock in the afternoon to look for the,

01:43:17.266 --> 01:43:25.432
for the jewels, I find jewels, I gave him and he find eh too but till today I could not understand

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:33.515
why he didn't shoot me, because he w, I, he could, he could have think that I'm going to tell

01:43:33.515 --> 01:43:41.598
somebody for the other Germans will find out, you know, that I, that, that I gave him the jewelry

01:43:41.598 --> 01:43:49.847
from the, from the, from under the sand and it was also a miracle that he didn't kill me. Because

01:43:49.847 --> 01:43:57.846
after I got the jewelry, he could have take me to the death camp and and kill me. So I have many

01:43:57.846 --> 01:44:01.430
miracles in life. In Sobibor and in Izbica.

01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:09.068
But we were you were, you were so lucky. But we were talking about those trials.

01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:15.180
After, Hagen was the only one and now Demjanjuk is the next one?

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:33.247
Demjanjuk, Demjanjuk's trial was very important for me to go and to testify.

01:44:33.247 --> 01:44:47.840
Because eh [turning page] I want to read this to you, so it's

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.780
Do so

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:49.590
so let's put together

01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:51.200
if you want to do so

01:44:56.150 --> 01:45:05.619
what. Three months ago I went to Germany to Munich to testify on Demjanjuk's trial. He's accused

01:45:05.619 --> 01:45:15.373
of having served in Sobibor as one of the Ukrainian guards during the six months when I was in Sobibor.

01:45:15.373 --> 01:45:25.505
I was a prisoner in camp. I cannot recognize the, Mister Demjanjuk. But, eh nor can I rem, eh rec, remember

01:45:25.505 --> 01:45:34.975
the faces of most of Sobibor guards. During the court proceeding I simply informed the German judges

01:45:34.975 --> 01:45:44.823
that, that they, of the crimes that, that I witness at Sobibor. Including the tales of how the Ukrainian

01:45:44.823 --> 01:45:54.482
guards routinely supervised beat and shot Jewish prisoners. Mister Demjanjuk's attorney defended his

01:45:54.482 --> 01:46:04.236
client by saying that all Ukrainian guards at Sobibor were prisoners of war. Who would have been killed

01:46:04.236 --> 01:46:13.800
by the Germans if they did not follow the orders. [leest deels teksten voor]But I believe that nobody

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:23.554
has the right to save his life by beating or shooting innocent men, women and children. There is always

01:46:23.554 --> 01:46:33.213
a moral responsibility to resist anti moral act, anti moral order. If the court determines that Mister

01:46:33.213 --> 01:46:42.777
Demjanjuk served as, at Sobibor, then justice demands that he be punished approx, proprietly. For not

01:46:42.777 --> 01:46:52.720
resisting the orders that he received. Justice in this case will also send an important message to anyone

01:46:52.720 --> 01:47:02.568
who cont, contemplates or repels to carry out genocide today and in the future. Indeed my survival means

01:47:02.568 --> 01:47:11.943
very little if Hitler's legacy of genocide goes on. Or lives on. At Sobibor we did not only fight

01:47:11.943 --> 01:47:21.507
for, for our lives and for revenge. Up, (?) or, or lives and for revenge, we also fought for a better

01:47:21.507 --> 01:47:31.072
tomorrow. A better day, a better future, a world without racism and a world without genocide. My life

01:47:31.072 --> 01:47:41.015
and the life of my five children and fifteen grandchildren are part of this better world. But even though

01:47:41.015 --> 01:47:50.484
I helped to destroy the Sobibor of the Germans others have build new Sobibors. The systematic murder

01:47:50.484 --> 01:48:00.049
of innocent human beings continues even in the 21st century. Genocide still occurs in parts of Africa

01:48:00.049 --> 01:48:09.518
where hundreds of thousands of human beings have been murdered in recent years only because of their

01:48:09.518 --> 01:48:19.461
race. I think you have it there already. [turns page] As peaceful people and human beings we must condemn

01:48:19.461 --> 01:48:29.120
these acts just as we condemn Hitler's over sixty years ago. Of course we hope that our condemnation

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:38.969
will stop hatred and genocide. But at Sobibor we learned that sometimes we must defend ourselves against

01:48:38.969 --> 01:48:48.343
the Hitlers of the, of the, of the, of the, our generation. Not just to make speeches and hope that

01:48:48.343 --> 01:48:58.097
somebody else is listening. Just as I did in Sobibor, all of us must (?) or hope in our fighting spirit

01:48:58.097 --> 01:49:07.756
to preserve both our lives and the lives of our fellow human beings. We cannot continue to abandon our

01:49:07.756 --> 01:49:17.510
fellow human beings in their time of need. Sobibor stands of, forever as a warning of what happens when

01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:25.559
we follow, we allow barbarism to grow out of control. I have more but it's, it's-

01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:30.570
When did you start going back to Sobibor?

01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:31.700
Huh?

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.260
When did you go back the first time to Sobibor?

01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:42.105
I went back eh when I, we made a we made a documentary film Hunt for stolen war treasures. With

01:49:42.105 --> 01:49:49.950
Michael York, from England. We went to, to look for these treasures, because I wa, I my brother

01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:57.878
told me to put some, hid some, hide some jewelry in jars. In case we survive, you have something

01:49:57.878 --> 01:50:05.888
to live from. So I, a few days before the uprising I took a big jar from the mother from Holland,

01:50:05.888 --> 01:50:13.733
you know, I put in jewel, eh, diamonds, rubies and emeralds, maybe a million dollars. And I put

01:50:13.733 --> 01:50:21.496
it underneath, by a tree. Maybe I, eh, by the, a couple feet low but they made, they made a f,

01:50:21.496 --> 01:50:29.506
they made a film Hunt for stolen war treasures and some of the participants they were looking for

01:50:29.506 --> 01:50:37.434
a trail from paintings, all kinds of things. But my part on the documentary what they showed all

01:50:37.434 --> 01:50:45.527
over the world, was the best. I got, I, I, I got a review of the best, that the, the producer told

01:50:45.527 --> 01:50:53.372
me. We went to and we took some people that went, it was under communism yet and we were hi, we

01:50:53.372 --> 01:51:01.300
were looking, we are looking for the trees, where I have hidden the, older pine trees, you know,

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:09.310
after, after the, after the uprising they brought eh, they brought eh, some prisoners from Belzec

01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:17.073
to destroy the, the Sobibor and they plant, and they, eh, and they planted eh pine trees. So I

01:51:17.073 --> 01:51:24.836
was counting the, the branches. Because every year is a branch. And I figured, I, it's no so

01:51:24.836 --> 01:51:28.800
many branches that will mean this is a new tree.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.140
Yes

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:37.873
If it's more branches, that's an old tree. But the same time I said if we find it, the, the Germans,

01:51:37.873 --> 01:51:46.439
with the Poles, eh, eh, the communist will take it away. But eh we couldn't find anything. So I made

01:51:46.439 --> 01:51:55.088
a statement, this the, the old ter, the old terrain changed. Most of the, most often I think that they,

01:51:55.088 --> 01:52:04.158
the Poles, they, they, they, they were digging, they took everything out. But, but if, if we find something,

01:52:04.158 --> 01:52:12.724
this this eh, this, be, eh, if, if, if there is something, this, it belongs to the 250,000 people that

01:52:12.724 --> 01:52:21.121
perished. And we left. And then, then we went we went to to Izbica to the cemetery. So we came after

01:52:21.121 --> 01:52:29.519
Izbica in the cemetery we were shocked. All skeletons, all bones, all, all, all, all, all, all over.

01:52:29.519 --> 01:52:37.833
A Polish guy, I was holding a skeleton, she said, this could be your mother, when they, were shot.

01:52:37.833 --> 01:52:46.566
She was shot here. I was very, very, I was very emotional. And they may filmed it. This when they showed

01:52:46.566 --> 01:52:55.300
it all over the world, I got, I got, they call me, I got letter, telegrams you know? About that episode.

01:52:55.300 --> 01:53:03.530
I took, and I took that skeleton and I took some bones, I made a package and I figured I'll take

01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:11.844
it to to eh, to, to New York, and gave it eh, eh a religious burial, you know, all the human bones.

01:53:11.844 --> 01:53:20.325
And when I came to Frankfurt I went through the machine a young guy, he went, oh, and he want to call

01:53:20.325 --> 01:53:28.639
the police. That I killed somebody, you know, the bones. You know, I said to him, listen, we would,

01:53:28.639 --> 01:53:37.205
I got emotional, I said I was crying, I said this is my family. And he, and, and, and he got emotional

01:53:37.205 --> 01:53:45.518
too. He said he can loose his job, but he's going to let me through with it, because he knows how

01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:53.832
I feel and I took, I took the package to New York. In New York they didn't check me and I, and I,

01:53:53.832 --> 01:54:02.398
we took ten people, we made a minyan, you know? And we made a religious, a religious ceremony and the,

01:54:02.398 --> 01:54:10.796
and there were have a, we, every city in New York has (?) from Izbica, they have a little, they have

01:54:10.796 --> 01:54:10.880
a

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:10.880
Circle

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:15.229
(?) too and we bu, we gave it a burial. This is a very good, so it's, everything is in the

01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:19.390
book. So you have my book and your books knowing everything, we have two books the same.

01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:23.960
No, mine is not going to be a book. Eh

01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:27.470
Huh?

01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:33.520
This is not going to be a book, eh I'm thinking

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:38.230
I think you have, you have, you have already too much information. So eh, it's eh (?)

01:54:38.230 --> 01:54:39.240
So what did you learn

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:39.240
Huh?

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:45.977
no, I'm, I'm going to back to Demjanjuk, I want to look for a good way

01:54:45.977 --> 01:54:52.350
to finish, eh you went to Munich to testify, I have seen you. You were

01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:52.740
Demjanjuk

01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:56.690
very, very strong

01:54:56.690 --> 01:54:58.150
you, you were on the, you were at the trial?

01:54:58.150 --> 01:54:58.150
Yes, I was sitting upstairs

01:54:58.150 --> 01:55:03.742
You saw Demjanjuk, he's laying like a, he is laying, he makes believe that he's

01:55:03.742 --> 01:55:09.200
sick with the, with the, with the, eh, with eh baseball cap on his face, you know

01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.870
Yes

01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:16.425
and eh and he, he he, I, I mentioned in the, mine in mine eh, to the,

01:55:16.425 --> 01:55:22.220
to the judges, that he didn't come to Sobibor for vacation.

01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:22.400
No

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:30.283
He came for a purpose. He came to commit genocide. Beating and shooting. So

01:55:30.283 --> 01:55:38.167
even if I don't recognize his face, but if he was there, he participated.

01:55:38.167 --> 01:55:45.210
In all the, in all the atrocities and he should be, he should be eh

01:55:45.210 --> 01:55:45.430
Punished

01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:46.910
penalized accordingly.

01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.910
Yes.

01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:55.501
So any, any penalty what he will get, would, it wouldn't be enough. But what, what Sobibor, what Sobibor

01:55:55.501 --> 01:56:03.930
stands for, what, what, what, what happened in Sobibor. Every day in Sobibor was a challenge to survive.

01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:12.116
You know. And if, be a witness to, to what happened in Sobibor and to to be able to to survive and to

01:56:12.116 --> 01:56:18.600
tell the story, and I hope mine stories will, will contribute to a better world.

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.170
Thank you Philip, thank you.

01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:26.260
You ha, you have, you have t
