00:09.680 --> 00:18.726
Toivi, you wanted to talk about the Shtetl about the place where you lived as a small

00:18.726 --> 00:27.879
boy. Thank you for allowing me your time. It is December, eh, 15, 2009. This is Thomas

00:27.879 --> 00:36.500
Blatt, alias Toivi Blatt, which is his Polish name. Please talk about your Shtetl

00:36.500 --> 00:49.932
I'm born in a small Jewish town, Izbica in Eastern Poland. The, the town had about 3,600 people, that's

00:49.932 --> 01:02.989
all 96% Jewish. It started in the 16th century und eh, it was very poor. Very religious, orthodox. There

01:02.989 --> 01:16.045
was a famous rabbi in Izbica Landau eh . My father was well off in Izbica because he had a liquor store.

01:16.045 --> 01:28.473
Eh be, he was in the Polish eh, volunteered to the Polish legionnaires, PiÅ‚sudski's legionnaires

01:28.473 --> 01:41.153
and he was wounded. Eh, because of it, he had this eh business, the liquor store. So we had a way to,

01:41.153 --> 01:53.833
to, to make a living. Most of the Jewish had little shops , they were peddlers For me, Izbica was the

01:53.833 --> 02:06.261
eh centre of the world. I didn't want to go any place else, I loved this town. Izbica was used by

02:06.261 --> 02:19.192
the Germans later as a trap, because on three sides Izbica was surrounded by hill sides. And the fourth

02:19.192 --> 02:32.123
side was a river. So it was enough for Germans to put a few soldiers on the hill sides and no.., nobody

02:32.123 --> 02:44.677
could escape from the town. Because from the top of the town you could look down and see everything,

02:44.677 --> 02:57.607
from the top of the hill. Izbica was later used as a transit ghetto and we'll speak later about this.

02:57.607 --> 03:10.161
Eh what could I say? I had eh a brother, Hersz Ber we used to live in a house which years, years ago

03:10.161 --> 03:23.092
was a beautiful house caughs, two floors and now, and I remember 1938 and '39 to the fall, it already

03:23.092 --> 03:35.521
was devastated, no repairs, the dach, the, the roof used to leak and eh but I still was happy to be

03:35.521 --> 03:48.326
there. When it was raining we had some trouble, because the water from the hill side that used go down

03:48.326 --> 04:02.010
to the , to the town and we had a water up to the knees practically some time. My father was not particularly

04:02.010 --> 04:14.438
religious and they called him Leibele Goy. Goy was a synonym of a person who doesn't believe, who

04:14.438 --> 04:27.620
is tough and so on. Eh at one time my dad, I remember him many times he closed the windows, the shutters,

04:27.620 --> 04:40.049
locked the door, he smoked cigarettes on shabbes, eat eh non-kosher meat, I've seen everything eh

04:40.049 --> 04:52.603
and I realize eh, eh he shouldn't do it, but he has done it and later he he, he get me to try, and

04:52.603 --> 05:05.031
Rasko too and I did try, it was very good. And I didn't understand why it is forbidden for Jewish

05:05.031 --> 05:17.962
to eat it. So it was an old house and the later generations after generations, you know, it was divided

05:17.962 --> 05:30.642
in the, for, for the, for the family for in, in eh, on the end side I remember in 1938/'39, eh, eh,

05:30.642 --> 05:43.196
it were few very small eh rooms for each eh member of the extended family. We did live in a two room

05:43.196 --> 05:55.750
apartment we had to say, eh, it was a kitchen, a small kitchen, there was there over there a bed for

05:55.750 --> 06:08.429
the maid, hm, and eh eh later another room had a table, some chairs and still later was this bedroom,

06:08.429 --> 06:20.983
had two beds, very close to each other. And eh not far was the cemetery with a lot of trees and each

06:20.983 --> 06:33.537
morning did the, eh, I, all remember, looking through the window, a flock of birds did go over from,

06:33.537 --> 06:44.711
from the trees, eh, on the cemetery and they flow over our house, I still remember this.-

06:45.330 --> 06:48.480
Is it easier for you to talk German? Or is English all right?

06:48.480 --> 06:48.890
Eh

06:48.890 --> 06:49.070
Es kann auch in Deutsch. Ist das leichter?

06:49.070 --> 06:50.330
English is okay?

06:50.330 --> 07:07.437
Eh, I said, I said, very religious, eh, my, my dad didn't go to, to the Sjiel every day, but eh Yom

07:07.437 --> 07:23.190
Kippur he did go. He had his own place I remember on the western side I think of the Sjiel eh

07:23.190 --> 07:31.500
Did you go with him?

07:31.590 --> 07:35.030
Once in a while, it was only once in a year Yom Kippur.

07:35.030 --> 07:35.870
Of course

07:37.070 --> 07:37.530
[grins]

07:37.530 --> 07:37.890
[laughs]

07:37.890 --> 07:49.080
So what else do I remember? We didn't have toilets. If you want to

07:49.080 --> 07:49.250
Of course

07:49.250 --> 07:59.220
if you want to go, you did run to, out house and, eh, half a mile away, many times I didn't make

07:59.220 --> 08:08.580
it in time. And eh I remember the, eh, we called WassertrÃ¤ger, the guy who delivered water.

08:08.580 --> 08:08.670
Water

08:08.670 --> 08:19.844
He was always a person mentally ill, eh, he did deliver water in buckets, we had in the home a big container

08:19.844 --> 08:30.191
von metal sheet, eh, twice a day he did bring us the water. No, it wasn't like now. To make a meal

08:30.191 --> 08:39.400
was a big job, it wasn't like now you go to the wall, you turn a switch and you have eh water cooking

08:39.400 --> 08:40.480
Yes of course

08:40.480 --> 08:49.369
and when you really need to go to the eh special closet and pick up wood and start

08:49.369 --> 08:58.041
a fire in the kitchen, eh was a whole ceremony and finally there were some meal,

08:58.041 --> 09:07.580
good meal if my mother made it. I remember the commandant of the police, BÃ¼rgermeister,

09:07.580 --> 09:14.410
used to come to us, eh Fridays to try my mother's fish, carp.

09:14.410 --> 09:18.260
Oh it's lovely, carp, isn't it?

09:18.260 --> 09:18.990
Pardon?

09:19.170 --> 09:19.400
Wonderful

09:19.400 --> 09:19.690
Yes

09:19.690 --> 09:21.620
An old traditional Jewish carp is

09:21.620 --> 09:28.657
Yeah, and eh, they put the rifles in the co, in the corner of the room and I immediately

09:28.657 --> 09:35.214
fast closed the rifle, checking, my mother was shaking because, don't touch that

09:35.214 --> 09:41.932
[grins] because it could shoot immediately. Later when they eat, they say thank you,

09:41.932 --> 09:47.530
they kissed my mothers hand, they wanted to be elegant. And they left.

09:47.530 --> 09:48.540
So they behaved well towards Jews?

09:48.750 --> 09:49.290
Pardon?

09:49.290 --> 09:50.180
They behaved well

09:50.180 --> 09:51.330
Yes, but

09:51.330 --> 09:51.590
towards Jews?

09:51.590 --> 10:00.177
the same policeman later were beasts they took us to the train stations on. This I remember, I

10:00.177 --> 10:09.130
remember her see them dancing on the street. I remember when the Jews, a Jewish Jud from ZamoÅ›Ä‡,

10:09.130 --> 10:17.808
a neighboring city, that eh arrived Saturday on bicycles without a hat, eh, oh God! The Zamosce

10:17.808 --> 10:25.300
goy might hear, the, the, the, chassid orthodox Jews, they chased them with stones..

10:25.300 --> 10:34.380
Really? ..yes, chased them out from the city immediately. Saturday, with a bike, without

10:34.380 --> 10:43.694
a hat! I went out, I had, eh took down my hat, immediately I put on my yarmulke,

10:43.694 --> 10:52.309
you should leave a second without yarmulke I did I wear, I did wear payes.

10:52.310 --> 10:52.820
You?

10:52.820 --> 10:59.330
Yeah, can believe me, looking at me, I mean, me with payes Hm. But, eh, eh, say so, there

10:59.330 --> 11:05.693
said so many people, Oi, Toivi, I can't believe it! If your grandpa would get up von,

11:05.693 --> 11:11.984
eh von, von his grave and look at you, the way you are now, he would go voluntary back

11:11.984 --> 11:17.690
to the grave. Because I didn't have payes, I didn't have tzitzis some kind

11:17.690 --> 11:22.630
Yes, but it's a different time, and look what has happened

11:22.630 --> 11:22.860
Yeah

11:22.860 --> 11:22.910
[laughs]

11:22.910 --> 11:32.035
So eh, I, I was no Jew actually according to the standards that time, how you should behave. I should

11:32.035 --> 11:41.071
say, eh eh, eh, eh, a blessing for bread and for water and eh, I, I did know a few words and I hated

11:41.071 --> 11:48.390
the Jewish school. I lo, I loved the Polish school. On Sunday was no mathematics.

11:48.390 --> 11:48.960
You like mathematics?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.390
No! I hated it.

11:50.390 --> 11:50.740
Okay

11:50.740 --> 11:59.086
But I left eh, I left eh, I liked the public school, and I did, in, in literature I was very good. And

11:59.086 --> 12:07.678
eh eh, eh I liked, I remember, liked religion. When other kids were saying oh, religion is not important,

12:07.678 --> 12:16.188
we go to the, to the river, I was sitting and listening, it was a beautiful stories about Salomon, about

12:16.188 --> 12:22.980
eh David so I didn't understand why the guys didn't want to listen the stories.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.560
The Bible is narrative, it is beautiful

12:24.560 --> 12:25.290
Yes

12:26.220 --> 12:27.850
Yeah Beautiful

12:34.140 --> 12:35.450
[eats]

12:35.450 --> 12:35.860
So on

12:35.860 --> 12:41.040
I didn't'want to, I didn't want to go to the Jewish school, the so-called Cheider

12:41.040 --> 12:41.900
Yeah?

12:41.900 --> 12:50.955
Because there was a long table, there was about eight boys sitting and each one had a seder, a book

12:50.955 --> 13:00.102
and you read a paragraph later the rabbi, the rabbie, not rabbi, the rabbie said: next one. The next

13:00.102 --> 13:09.706
one would start to read a paragraph and went on this, I didn't understand it. Everything was in Hebrew,

13:09.706 --> 13:18.853
so eh, after a while the you yawn and the rabbi had, the rabbie, had a when you eh would yawn he put

13:18.853 --> 13:26.720
in his eh his stick which he did eh point at in the book, he put in the, in the mouth.

13:26.720 --> 13:27.300
Ja.

13:27.300 --> 13:35.055
The guy who, yawned, oh God. This is what I remember and I didn't learn anything in the

13:35.055 --> 13:42.810
jiddish school and when I went sometime to the Sjiel, pretending I know something, I took

13:42.810 --> 13:50.740
this b, this book, the sacred Thora, how you call it, and was shaking, I , the other people

13:50.740 --> 13:57.450
were shaking, and when it's time, when everybody said Amen, I repeated Amen

13:57.450 --> 13:57.650
[laughs]

13:57.650 --> 14:05.153
and it was good. You know, but they didn't have an idea that I don't, except

14:05.153 --> 14:12.937
this paragraph, I don't know, nothing more. [coughs] And later, what do they have

14:12.937 --> 14:20.816
else? I didn't have Bar Mitzwa, no. And probably I wouldn't have because I hated

14:20.816 --> 14:27.100
the school, the Cheider. You have Bar Mitswa when you were thirteen

14:27.100 --> 14:35.749
You prepare for half a year or a year, so we had other problems than Bar Mitswa. So I didn't. Ja, I,

14:35.749 --> 14:43.890
I did read a lot. As a matter of fact, I did go to the position, but this was already in the war

14:44.020 --> 14:51.708
and I, before the war, I did read a rot, a lot because, m, my father was considered eh PiÅ‚sudski's

14:51.708 --> 14:59.245
k, legionair, volunteer eh, in Poland, in, in the fight for Poland. So my mother eh had privileges.

14:59.245 --> 15:04.270
And she could take books, loan books from the, eh, Polish Library.

15:04.270 --> 15:04.950
Hmhm

15:04.950 --> 15:14.802
So she took books from over there, and I steal it in the evening and did read it. There was some

15:14.802 --> 15:25.271
serious book eh, what I understood quite a lot. Eh, one book did eh effect me in a way, eh, I remember

15:25.271 --> 15:35.431
until now. It was the title too I remember, Gdy budzi sie bestia When the beast is awake. Awakened.

15:35.431 --> 15:45.386
It is a story of people that were thrown, eh, the tr, the ship sink and they were thrown on a, on

15:45.386 --> 15:55.752
an is, island and there were two women and eight men and they, oh, the whole story, eh, v, eh showing

15:55.752 --> 16:05.913
from the nice people before and they, when, when the ship was eh complete and how later they became

16:05.913 --> 16:15.868
beasts, fighting, with feelings of, for the woman and, and this did eh, never did, and every time

16:15.868 --> 16:25.926
later in the war, this book eh, eh, I, I, I have seen eh, eh, the way the book was eh, eh that the

16:25.926 --> 16:32.699
eh book portrayed the people eh exact the way you do, eh they are.

16:32.700 --> 16:39.670
That eh people could change. As a matter of fact, they ask me now what do you did learn from

16:39.670 --> 16:46.640
the Holocaust and I can't really speci, eh, pin point, but one thing I know I learned that

16:46.640 --> 16:54.140
nobody knows them selves in, in normal eh conditions they could be nice and polite, eh if something

16:54.140 --> 17:00.959
changes, you could be a, a, a beast. Depends everything, on the conditions you live in. In

17:00.959 --> 17:06.490
the situation, the political situation, eh, economical situation. Anyway,

17:06.490 --> 17:06.850
You learned a lot

17:07.980 --> 17:08.980
Pardon?

17:10.520 --> 17:14.040
You learned a lot from those books

17:14.040 --> 17:20.870
Yeah, I, I remember till now, you can see, and also I stopped believing in God slowly.

17:20.870 --> 17:27.145
I mean, I ha, eh, eh, I still didn't believe what I learned that God could do

17:27.145 --> 17:33.419
everything, she, so, eh, eh, it was dark in Izbica, eh, the, as far as I remem,

17:33.419 --> 17:38.900
eh, remember we didn't have electrical light, we had kerosene light

17:38.900 --> 17:39.940
Yes, Of course

17:39.940 --> 17:49.789
because winter time is five o'clock you go to bed [grins] so, but eh, eh, I remember when the eh,

17:49.789 --> 18:00.435
eh rabbi died. And eh his wife, children were crying, you know, it wasn't like now, a funeral, everything

18:00.435 --> 18:09.290
is quiet, you know, in that time you did scream on the street and your hand, a finger, so

18:09.950 --> 18:10.540
Tear your clothes?

18:10.540 --> 18:19.144
Yes, and I was thinking why did the rabbi die? It's a rabbi, he should live, long, long,

18:19.144 --> 18:27.461
long, he's Gods person! he was and later, than later the synagogue was on fire. And I

18:27.461 --> 18:36.448
said something is wrong. A synagogue is a, eh is Gods eh home, can he prevent it from burning?

18:36.448 --> 18:44.669
Anything else could burn, but not a synagogue! And so a little, flashes of disbelieve.

18:44.669 --> 18:52.891
Eventually I said goodbye to God in Sobibor. There is a survivor from Sobibor. I, I go

18:52.891 --> 18:59.010
out a little bit. There is a survivor from Sobibor, Esther Raab.

18:59.010 --> 18:59.290
Yes

18:59.290 --> 19:07.815
Esther , and I heard her saying, Esther, had, what, eh why did you survive, I mean, what, what

19:07.815 --> 19:16.431
eh, had, tell me about your survival, she said God. God, because of God. Once it made me really

19:16.431 --> 19:25.137
mad and I told her, Esther okay, you did come to Sobibor with two sisters and your parents. They

19:25.137 --> 19:33.934
were taken away, you was left. You can't take it at one side, I survive because of God. If this

19:33.934 --> 19:42.460
is the case, your parents and your sister died because of God too. And I don't want the hear

19:42.460 --> 19:50.985
anymore about God. So, I stopped believing at all, if you ask me now, I believe that something

19:50.985 --> 19:59.510
exists which is running our world, but not in the sense of eh God, if you beg him, you pray to

19:59.510 --> 20:08.216
him and he will help you. Eh, if I would be a believer, I believe in a terrible God. Eh, anyway,

20:08.216 --> 20:16.832
going back to Izbica. Eh in Izbica eh it was not so , or eh I'm going eh to Toivi Blatt, eh a

20:16.832 --> 20:25.902
friend of mine, I did never say I'm going to Toivi Blatt, I'm going to, to, to, to Toivi Leibele

20:25.902 --> 20:32.160
Goyish. Eh every man, every person had a, how you call it, eh synonym

20:32.160 --> 20:34.390
Yes, a pseudonym

20:34.390 --> 20:38.213
and, and this, told the whole story eh very, there was a guy,

20:38.213 --> 20:41.410
we called him Jo, eh, I'm going to Dziobaty lojne

20:41.410 --> 20:41.440
What is Jojne, a city? Join is an English word. Yes

20:41.440 --> 20:41.610
Your name

20:41.610 --> 20:44.940
but what does it mean?

20:44.940 --> 20:52.703
J, eh, no, no, it's a Jiddish word, I don't know, but Dziobaty is in Polish,

20:52.703 --> 21:00.079
Dziobaty is chicken pock Jojne, and you needed not have chicken pocks or you

21:00.079 --> 21:06.290
go to, another, our neighbor, eh, Liza Schetszke. Liza is a name

21:06.850 --> 21:07.090
Of course

21:07.090 --> 21:07.710
an Jiddish name

21:07.710 --> 21:13.166
Schetszke is straw, you know you make it for the, for the food for the horses, eh, you

21:13.166 --> 21:18.370
got, is, it's straw from the, from common straw when, which you cut a little, eh

21:18.370 --> 21:18.540
Yes

21:18.540 --> 21:24.752
eh this is called Schetszke, this was food for her horses, he dealed with horses, so I did

21:24.752 --> 21:30.757
know Liza Schetszke, Schetszke horse, he's a, he had something to do with the horses.

21:30.757 --> 21:36.279
Eh, now there was Lu, Lume Janku, Janku is a name, but Lume means, eh, their leg

21:36.280 --> 21:36.480
Leg, leg

21:36.480 --> 21:41.694
is bad, lame, lame, Lame Janku and everybody has it and eh we d, they,

21:41.694 --> 21:46.090
the story of his, at least part of his story who he is and. Were there many people, two hundred or three hundred people,

21:46.090 --> 21:48.520
How many people were there? I have a list actually of Jews from 193. In that time there were 3000 or so much.

21:48.520 --> 21:48.790
That is a lot

21:48.790 --> 21:53.027
Many of our jews were there, many, many. Exceot that the, the Bu, the

21:53.027 --> 21:57.879
BÃ¼rgermeister, the major of the city, commandant of the police, the policeman,

21:57.879 --> 22:01.380
the postmaster, were Christians. The rest only Jews. Yes?

22:01.380 --> 22:07.990
So you talked about everybody knowing each other very close

22:08.720 --> 22:15.710
Close after I was liberated and I go to Izbica for my hiding coming to Izbica with another

22:15.710 --> 22:22.390
two Jews and we stay in the middle of the market place, I look around in a place where

22:22.390 --> 22:29.147
everybody didn't know each other, where no door was open for me, ai, Toivi look here,

22:29.147 --> 22:35.905
come in, come in, come in, they would say always, friendly I didn't have where to go.

22:35.905 --> 22:42.662
I can't go to my home because some, eh, eh, eh other people living over there and eh,

22:42.662 --> 22:48.099
so I did run away from over there, from the same day, it was terrible.

22:48.100 --> 22:54.020
It struck me that your book really stops at this moment

22:54.020 --> 23:00.350
Yes, yes, when I did run away. That was a bit later, yes. So.

23:00.350 --> 23:03.130
So you went back to Izbit, Iz, Izbica

23:03.130 --> 23:11.638
I go every year back to Izbica. This year eh, yes I was there this year in Izbica too. It's a

23:11.638 --> 23:20.416
strange place, I, I meet, eh, boys, Christian boys which chased me want to deliver me to the Nazis

23:20.416 --> 23:28.030
and eh, in Germ, eh, and I talked eh, they read my late, latest interview in Polytika

23:28.030 --> 23:28.800
Yes?

23:28.800 --> 23:38.256
Ja. Too bad, because I have it here in the home. Anyway eh I meet guys which did eh, give, give,

23:38.256 --> 23:47.417
give, eh deliver Jews to the Germans. You can't do anything. And in my latest interview, I,

23:47.417 --> 23:56.873
I said to this interviewer from Polytika, eh, lately that eh in Germany, in Frankfurt and Berlin

23:56.873 --> 24:06.132
I have seen many houses with little eh brass eh labels, as if here eh was eh, was living a Jew

24:06.132 --> 24:15.194
and this and this and this name, a memorial in some way. I remember in some way. Than I say,

24:15.194 --> 24:24.454
no, no this is a co, eh completely different story, you don't mention they were Jewish. Many

24:24.454 --> 24:33.713
Jew, many Christians in, in Izbica they don't even know that we in the history of of, of eh,

24:33.713 --> 24:40.510
easily said that their houses were actually 100% Jewish houses, yeah.

24:40.510 --> 24:47.090
It's a kind of silence

24:47.090 --> 24:55.031
Yes, the, eh, the, eh, I was wondering, I eh, when I spoke to German people, German public, I can speak,

24:55.031 --> 25:02.744
I spoke a few weeks ago, about 800, eh people, eh, have, a feeling that they are listening what I'm

25:02.744 --> 25:10.228
talking about, the feeling, a feeling, I'm reaching somebody and in Poland eh I have a different

25:10.228 --> 25:17.788
feeling. They still, they still don't go out open, they still going, come in, how could they help

25:17.788 --> 25:25.425
Jews and so through this? That if a Pole helps the Jew he's really a hero. Because they the common

25:25.425 --> 25:32.985
conditions in Poland were different than the conditions in another country. But eh eh, but how many

25:32.985 --> 25:40.698
were of them. And they were afraid of the neighbors a young man eh, me, a Pole delivered to the, into

25:40.698 --> 25:48.334
the eh Sobibor, brother too, my father didn't want to go out, von, where, where will he go, go, go

25:48.334 --> 25:56.353
out from the ghetto and he will be immediately delivered and beaten and so on. So this was our situation.

25:56.353 --> 26:03.836
And the, the German didn't recognize the, eh, who's a Jew, who is not a Jew. They were taught,

26:03.836 --> 26:11.473
eh, to, eh, they were, eh, they teach them about Jews in Germany and the, the typical Jewish that we

26:11.473 --> 26:19.262
have big eyes and a long nose and this and this and this, so they wouldn't be able to recognize the,

26:19.262 --> 26:27.204
they looked for Jews with long beard without, I don't know, the Poles, so then the Polish youth sought

26:27.204 --> 26:30.029
them, saw who was a Jew, who was not.

26:30.030 --> 26:30.378
Tovi, I have two themes I want to come back to. I want to come back

26:30.378 --> 26:30.680
to the Polish attitude, because it is so important for you.. Polish?

26:30.680 --> 26:33.298
..The attitude towards the Jew. But let us now go back to your old

26:33.298 --> 26:35.630
place. You never expected The poles to become so hostile?

26:35.630 --> 26:44.177
I thought my, eh, eh, I was naïve, naïve was I. When I have seen a Pole beating another Pole and

26:44.177 --> 26:52.898
this was the first year of the German occupation, [swallows] I thought 'what's happened here?'

26:52.898 --> 27:01.533
He's a Polish policeman beating another Pole for something, I don't know for what, when we have

27:01.533 --> 27:10.080
a common enemy! Why does he bea, beat his brother? And later I was thinking what's happened here

27:10.080 --> 27:18.452
in Izbica? swallows The Germans invaded Poland Now a German was a Polish enemy and we should get

27:18.452 --> 27:26.825
together, the Poles, now we have a common enemy, should get together Poles and Jews and not hurt

27:26.825 --> 27:35.372
each other at least. I was never to understand it why the Poles, and some of the police eh helping

27:35.372 --> 27:44.181
the Germans. But later eh, I was aware what the partisans would do eh, it was difficult to understand

27:44.181 --> 27:49.240
why eh, eh, we are, we are not together facing this enemy.

27:49.240 --> 27:56.460
Did you expect this to be when the Germans invaded Poland?

27:56.460 --> 27:58.870
No, that what I say, I expected that now we have a common enemy.

27:58.870 --> 27:59.650
Yes, exactly, yes

27:59.650 --> 28:01.450
I think, we were closer than ever. Yes

28:01.450 --> 28:06.770
But why eh is happened that it was further, further away.

28:06.770 --> 28:07.720
Yes, sure

28:07.720 --> 28:08.910
No, because, you see

28:08.910 --> 28:09.370
Yes, I understand

28:09.370 --> 28:17.782
The Poland didn't want eh, eh, the, eh, the Jews. The Jew was a competitor in business and

28:17.782 --> 28:26.378
eh, many aspects. So in, in, eh, they were happy. I want to say it plain. They were happy that

28:26.378 --> 28:34.974
their dream, Poland without Jews, is finally coming true. So eh they are saying till now, many

28:34.974 --> 28:42.290
Poles, that one good thing which Hitler has done is cleaned up Poland from Jews.

28:42.290 --> 28:47.261
I know, I know. But when the, the Germans invaded, when

28:47.261 --> 28:51.690
were you for the first time confronted with this?

28:51.690 --> 28:58.370
When I, eh, when the war started my parents were, were, eh, seeking shelter in the forest.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.090
Yes

28:59.190 --> 29:03.790
When they did come back the Germans moved out from, from Izbica.

29:03.790 --> 29:03.940
Hm

29:03.940 --> 29:08.989
They did come to Izbica when the fighting was on, later there was agreement

29:08.989 --> 29:13.770
between the Sovjet Union and the Germans, about the division of Poland.

29:15.100 --> 29:15.290
Molotov-Ribbentroppact

29:15.290 --> 29:22.324
So Izbica did go back to the Germans. When I arrived with my parents from the forest, eh, eh, I

29:22.324 --> 29:29.581
was also, take a look the war is end, at the end, Poland surrendered and I didn't see one German

29:29.581 --> 29:36.690
soldier. And my brother said 'oh, next to the bakery there are still two soldiers'. So I run

29:36.690 --> 29:43.725
to the bakery, there they are, loading bread on the bike, they had regular bikes, and eh he did

29:43.725 --> 29:50.020
throw me a siga, eh, candy and I said to, Danke schÃ¶n, eh, scheinen dank, in Jiddish

29:50.020 --> 29:50.360
Hmhm

29:50.360 --> 29:57.150
So you correcting is not a scheinen dank, is danke schÃ¶n. They looked nice, eh, and they left,

29:57.150 --> 30:03.798
so this was my first encounter. When the first Germans, I heard, arrived in Izbica they shot,

30:03.798 --> 30:10.375
they killed about six Jews. But everybo, everybody said 'oh is because the war conditions,

30:10.375 --> 30:16.809
they did just come in and shooting, fighting with the J, with the Polish soldiers'. So I

30:16.809 --> 30:23.528
remember many Jews said oh, if they would shoot at least two hundred Jews, three hundred Jews,

30:23.528 --> 30:30.105
that would be a blessing. Because all Jews would run away together with the Russians. And so

30:30.105 --> 30:34.680
we said oh because of war conditions. And later it was too late.

30:34.680 --> 30:43.910
But you, when did you for the first feel this hostility from the Poles?

30:44.770 --> 30:45.670
From the Poles?

30:45.670 --> 30:46.280
Yes

30:46.320 --> 30:56.159
Eh when the Germans did come back to Poland, eh to Izbica, the Russians left, the Germans come back.

30:56.159 --> 31:05.899
But for about a week there was, how would I say, eh, a, a lawless city. And that time eh two Polish

31:05.899 --> 31:15.640
men, Krudakosky Manjek and another one I can't remember, eh, written, in my book, threw a grenade

31:15.640 --> 31:25.086
to a group of Jews talking on the street. Killed a woman so on that point the Jews eh, the Poles

31:25.086 --> 31:35.220
came across because the Polish people and the Jews because the Jews cooperated with the, eh communists.

31:35.220 --> 31:44.862
It's in a, in a way true. What is true? True is number one that Izbica was poor, poorer than the

31:44.862 --> 31:54.308
poorest. I remember Friday, this little town, smelt of kerosene. Why? Because Saturday, Saturday

31:54.308 --> 32:03.852
started Friday. Shabbat. And the poor Jews were eh, this was, they went and washed herself in, eh

32:03.852 --> 32:08.870
it was louse, from the dirt, it was louses and they

32:08.870 --> 32:09.040
Louses

32:09.040 --> 32:11.510
washed herself, with the hair, with kerosene to get it

32:11.510 --> 32:13.050
With kerosene caps, yes

32:13.440 --> 32:20.619
Yes, so they smell, eh, eh, when the, there were very poor, the Jews, who belonged to the

32:20.619 --> 32:28.040
Communist Party did she, the poor people. My father didn't, didn't eh, belong, but other

32:28.040 --> 32:35.219
Jews, so we didn't, they didn't see, the Poles which were in the, in the Communist eh

32:35.219 --> 32:42.721
organization with the Jews, but they see the Jews. But it was a Jewish town, was mostly Jews.

32:42.721 --> 32:50.223
But were Poles too. And eh this was the eh revenge for the Jewish cooperation within, eh with

32:50.223 --> 32:57.805
the Communists. And from that time on la, eh, so, eh, as it did go to that point, that a group

32:57.805 --> 33:03.209
of Jews with eh, eh, the leader was m, m, eh, Miriam eh Reutenstein

33:03.210 --> 33:03.380
Hmhm

33:03.380 --> 33:09.403
my relative, went to Krasnystaw to the nearby city inviting the G, the, the German

33:09.403 --> 33:14.985
they should come in because it started to be impossible to be, to be lawless

33:14.985 --> 33:19.980
the town. And so, eh, pretty soon the German military eh kommendatur

33:19.980 --> 33:29.159
Kommandantur was established and everything was quiet down. But eh, in the end the Polish police eh,

33:29.159 --> 33:38.338
the Germans established Polish police, which collaborated with them and later the BÃ¼rgermeister was

33:38.338 --> 33:47.425
eh eh German, Volksdeutsch and eh, so it was going on we have seen it. A lot of Poles would like to

33:47.425 --> 33:56.604
help Jews but were afraid of the neighbors. And a lot of Poles were sorry for Jews, can't do much.

33:56.604 --> 34:05.967
The point is, is there were Poles which did help of course, but eh, they were afraid of the neighbors,

34:05.967 --> 34:15.422
because so, all the one voted the Germans that he or their par, the, the, eh, the people eh hiding Jews

34:15.422 --> 34:22.490
and the whole village was burned down. So that was a difficult situation. Ja.

34:22.490 --> 34:27.630
You were delivered by Polish policemen

34:27.630 --> 34:29.790
No, by Polish friend.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.990
Okay. Can you tell the story please?

34:32.990 --> 34:33.280
Eh

34:33.280 --> 34:34.800
This I would like

34:34.800 --> 34:40.560
Eh, must go fast from the beginning, just fast. Till I come to the story I will tell you the story.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.940
Sure

34:42.130 --> 34:51.449
Okay. The Germans arrived in 1939 . Izbica was established as a ghetto two Gestapo men arrived in Izbica

34:51.449 --> 35:00.857
and s, eh, eh, established a Ausser office eh outside office of Gestapo. They were terrible people. Every

35:00.857 --> 35:09.818
day they killed Jews on the street when they went on the stree, eh, out eh to the street. The street

35:09.818 --> 35:19.406
was empty. And if somebody by chance, and Jews went through, then they shot him. Terrible, later of course,

35:19.406 --> 35:28.815
eh, the, re, resetteled Jews from the, eh, eh, Posznan eh district to Izbica and later Czech Jews arrived

35:28.815 --> 35:37.954
and later German Jews arrived, and eh, there were a few a short time, eh, time in Izbica and then were

35:37.954 --> 35:47.274
taken to the eh death camps, they were killed. Eh my parents were in Izbica till late. Finally, in April

35:47.274 --> 35:56.413
28 actually a little bit earlier, earlier, my mother send me to Hungary. She one day she told me Toivi

35:56.413 --> 36:05.732
tonight you are leaving for Hungary. And I said ma, what, what do you mean, Hungary? I did know a little

36:05.732 --> 36:14.872
bit about Hungary. In that time, in 1942, the Hungarian people did live a relatively peaceful way. The

36:14.872 --> 36:24.012
killing of the Hungarian Jews started in 1944 when they sent them to Auschwitz. But 1942 was peaceful.

36:24.012 --> 36:32.973
So the dream of many Jews in Izbica was, how could I close the border to Hungary. At that point some

36:32.973 --> 36:41.934
Polish Christians, a group, under the leadership of Mishta Gayosh, they eh, told some Jewish people,

36:41.934 --> 36:51.342
for money we could you smuggle, we could smuggle you to Hungary. What they have done, they smuggled them.

36:51.342 --> 37:00.482
So I told my ma I know that the people which are smuggling Jews to Hungary for money, but did you hear

37:00.482 --> 37:09.532
the rumors, my mother asked me yes, I heard. Did you hear that the people were, are taken to a forest

37:09.532 --> 37:18.762
close to the Hungarian border and at a point they are telling the Jews, they already crossed the border

37:18.762 --> 37:28.081
to Hungary? Please sign the letter that you did cross the border so your parents, or your relatives will

37:28.081 --> 37:37.221
pay. And when you doing it, they killed. And everything is taken away from them. So my mother told me,

37:37.221 --> 37:46.361
yes Toivi, we know. But here we are waiting to be killed. Hungary, maybe it's not true, maybe, maybe

37:46.361 --> 37:55.680
eh is only a rumor. Up to you. So I said okay, let me think a minute, I'm going. It was two o'clock,

37:55.680 --> 38:04.909
I did go out to our group which are waiting, the leader, Gayosh, had already, he bought tickets for us,

38:04.909 --> 38:14.318
they gave us tickets and, into the darkness of the night, we managed to get out from Izibica to the train

38:14.318 --> 38:23.279
station. The train arrived, we were eight people, we jumped in the last wagon and we were on the way

38:23.279 --> 38:32.329
to Hungary. But we didn't make it. I was recognized. We, b, eh, it was a Jew, eh, a beautiful girl,

38:32.329 --> 38:41.290
but she has eh, eh, typical, I would say Semitic features. By the Semitic I mean, she had dark hair,

38:41.290 --> 38:50.250
curly hear, a little the nose was a little bit shoot, shoot a little bit too big maybe, eh anyway if

38:50.250 --> 38:57.419
somebody was looking for Jewish persons, he could recognize that she is Jewish.-

38:57.240 --> 38:58.370
But you

38:58.370 --> 38:58.650
Pardon?

38:58.650 --> 39:01.720
But you were very light

39:01.750 --> 39:10.403
Yeah, yeah, this is the, when I talk about tra, eh, this, this girl so, she was a girl and from Izbica

39:10.403 --> 39:18.632
she was standing close to the window, pretending that she's observing the scenery, but actually

39:18.632 --> 39:26.777
she hide her face. Then the conductor come and ask her for the tickets, she turned her face. And

39:26.777 --> 39:34.921
it's look like some fellow traveler did recognize her, because pretty soon, two, two Ukrainian

39:34.921 --> 39:43.235
policemen arrived and took her away. At this point I made a mistake. And instead to be exited like

39:43.235 --> 39:51.380
all the other eh, oh, they got a Jew and so on, I didn't know what to do, I was, I was fifteen

39:51.380 --> 39:59.864
years old I was so scared and I had a paper and I pretended to have been reading when everybody else

39:59.864 --> 40:08.178
was excited and talking, he's a felon, not in just reading. And so probable it was too dark like

40:08.178 --> 40:16.407
a sort eh, when my face, when my paper was ripped from my face, the cop is Ukrainian, papers? Now

40:16.407 --> 40:24.721
I did give my birth certificate eh forged birth certificate from the majors office, I was eh, that

40:24.721 --> 40:32.865
time was my name Ptaszek You are Jewish! No I'm not Jewish. You are Jewish! I'm not. You are

40:32.865 --> 40:41.519
Jewish! No. My face, eh, but my mouth said no, but my face said yes. [grins] But in, he still wasn't

40:41.519 --> 40:50.088
eh sure because I had lighter hair and, and my nose was a little bit ku, shorter and eh so and Poland

40:50.088 --> 40:54.330
was away to eh find out if I , this man is Jewish.

40:54.330 --> 40:54.590
Hm

40:54.590 --> 40:59.563
They simple check if you are circumcised. So he wasn't sure, he

40:59.563 --> 41:04.460
took me to the toilet, look down looked up to me and looked down

41:04.460 --> 41:12.023
he was surprised and now eh, I see he is confu, he's confused a little bit and now he's, he's,

41:12.023 --> 41:19.359
calls, Iwan, Godishuda. It was another gendarme which was further in the wagon and Iwan come see,

41:19.359 --> 41:26.695
Iwan looks down, Iwan you, look up, Iwan looks some confused. Why? What's happened? I had tried

41:26.695 --> 41:33.805
to correct the damage they already do to me, the circumcision. They are done with a string and

41:33.805 --> 41:41.141
with a look different but no miracles, it didn't help. The only, result was that everything was

41:41.141 --> 41:48.628
shown, eh, because of it they recog, their logical was they think I must be Jewish if I manipulated

41:48.628 --> 41:55.965
the, and they arrested me. Now to tell you the story till I, did come back to S, to Izbica, which

41:55.965 --> 42:03.377
takes you a whole day and night. So I will skip a half a year. I will just tell you, they arrested

42:03.377 --> 42:07.310
me. I was a half a year in jail in the city of Stryj

42:07.310 --> 42:09.630
That's described in your book, yes

42:09.630 --> 42:17.558
Yeah and later I did eh, I was in hospital and the last miracles with the g, I was listed

42:17.558 --> 42:25.575
as killed, because they killed another person instead me, and I eh, the twenty, eh, or the

42:25.575 --> 42:33.504
eighteen of April 1943 I was back in Izbica. And eh find out that my parents, that Izbica

42:33.504 --> 42:41.521
was considered Judenrein, v, earlier, and took, and they took all the Jews to Sobibor. And

42:41.521 --> 42:49.360
then later there was established general Judenstadt, Jews eh, did eh, s, allowed to come

42:49.360 --> 42:56.220
back. And this was a lure because a, a lot of Jews were hiding in the forest.

42:56.220 --> 42:56.430
Hm

42:56.430 --> 43:00.150
So the

43:00.780 --> 43:01.770
And your parents were still in Izbica?

43:01.770 --> 43:09.085
Eh, eh, my father was hidden, in hidden, was arrested, was at Gestapo. My mother was a, was

43:09.085 --> 43:16.401
a Polish eh woman, in Warsaw. I was in jail. And my little brother was some place hidden in

43:16.401 --> 43:23.717
the, in, in eh Izbica. Anyway, but now was a new eh, eh order, the Gestapo p, eh let my dad

43:23.717 --> 43:31.032
out, put in a, a, a, von, eh, dabei eh crown, in a Schein that Izbica is eh getting a Jude,

43:31.032 --> 43:38.589
eh, Judenstadt. The, if Jews should come back and put it so that some Jews being in the forest

43:38.589 --> 43:44.780
freezing because this was, eh, January, February, eh did come back to Izbica.

43:44.780 --> 43:45.350
Hmhm

43:45.600 --> 43:57.095
The Germans simple lured them back. And my dad and my ma did come back eh and so I arrived eh

43:57.095 --> 44:07.850
later, the situation was eh, that about 200 Jews were in a tannery. There was a tannery

44:07.850 --> 44:08.560
Hmhm

44:08.560 --> 44:16.344
and they let the tannery work as work because leather was a strategic product, eh until they will

44:16.344 --> 44:24.449
finish the job for the Gestapo and so on, so this was a group of illegally in Izbica. When I arrived.

44:24.449 --> 44:33.116
April 28 arrival shut me up and I understood that this is the end of Izbica, of our life. I was apprehended,

44:33.116 --> 44:41.543
taken outside, pushed into a group of the Jews which were already apprehended, were gathered by soldiers.

44:41.543 --> 44:49.407
Then I can manage to slip out from the group of the soldiers. My guard, the soldier who, who, who,

44:49.407 --> 44:57.111
the, who, he, he, he was standing next to me, but he want to smoke a cigarette, smoked, the wind

44:57.111 --> 45:04.815
had blown to, so he turned away his head, far away from wind, picked up his collar from his coat

45:04.815 --> 45:12.600
and smoked that cigarette. At that point I slipped out and mingled with the people, Polish people

45:12.600 --> 45:20.304
who had come and eh see my friend, Jannick Knapschick, a Polish friend, and ask him Jannick help

45:20.304 --> 45:28.008
and he said go to the barn, run to the barn, I go to the barn and eh, the barn has a lock on the

45:28.008 --> 45:36.033
gate and I was not far of home and on the hillside start to yell, Toivi run! Run! What's happened?

45:36.033 --> 45:44.299
Jannick is coming. So, if Jannick is coming, why should I run? He will open the g, the eh, the padlock.

45:44.299 --> 45:52.003
But Jannick is coming with a German man, he's a Jew, so the German took me to the market place

45:52.003 --> 46:00.108
and have seen out there that my parents, my brother sitting over there, so were two truck, two trucks

46:00.108 --> 46:07.972
arrived, covered with canvas. They told us to go in and eh, the trucks start to move in a northern

46:07.972 --> 46:10.219
direction where Sobibor was.

46:10.220 --> 46:16.330
So you were betrayed by a Pole?

46:16.330 --> 46:16.740
Pardon?

46:16.740 --> 46:19.430
You were betrayed by your Polish friend?

46:19.430 --> 46:26.120
I was betrayed, yes. My brother too for sure. And eh in the front of the two trucks was a jeep with

46:26.120 --> 46:32.811
a machine gun, soldiers in the back too, a jeep, machine gun, and we start to move in the direction

46:32.811 --> 46:39.569
of Sobibor. But still hoped everything could be taken away from somebody, hope will be there for the

46:39.569 --> 46:46.192
last minute. So this hope, because on the way from Izbica to Sobibor, where two off ramps to death

46:46.192 --> 46:52.815
camps, to concentration camps. And everything is better than a death camp. Actually if a for a Jew

46:52.815 --> 46:59.573
it was a blessing, he, he was looking and he, if he made to a concentration camp. If you was healthy

46:59.573 --> 47:05.250
and young you still had a chance to survive. In a death camp no selections, nothing.
Exactly.

47:05.250 --> 47:14.967
So but we were passing the off ramp to one concentration camp and the truck didn't turn and the second

47:14.967 --> 47:24.592
co, concentration camp, Travniki, until the next stop we know will be Sobibor and there is a talk, lead

47:24.592 --> 47:34.123
through ourselves of the, inside the trucks are the Germans, we will die anyway and a talk, these were

47:34.123 --> 47:43.561
young people and all the people will remember like my father said, no, we'll die anyway, let die eh

47:43.561 --> 47:52.998
as a family. And so we come to Sobibor. We are ordered to go down and down, I was seeing not far away

47:52.998 --> 48:02.529
a big fence, a long fence, green fence, it was green because it was interwoven with pine branches, and

48:02.529 --> 48:11.967
a gate with the name SS Sonderkommando So, told us to go in, open the gate, get in, went in, the gate

48:11.967 --> 48:21.311
is closed behind us. I look around, eh, and again, eh, eh, eh, a flicker of hope how could this be a

48:21.311 --> 48:30.749
death camp? It's a neat, nice, in the left side [swallows] was a little house eh Trojan style, with

48:30.749 --> 48:40.934
a, with a wooden sign, Schwalbenest, is which means Swallows nest, and eh, next to it was eh, got assignment,

48:40.934 --> 48:50.932
a name eh for this eh little house, this was the commandant's villa the Schwalbenest. Opposite in another

48:50.932 --> 49:00.744
side of the road was a, eh, platform, assembling eh, eh, and it looked like a train station, like a small

49:00.744 --> 49:10.368
train station. It was a sign to Warsaw, to Lublin, eh, pretending to be a train station, but it was not

49:10.368 --> 49:19.993
for the Polish Jews because the Polish Jews eh were aware eh, that this is eh, death camp, just was for

49:19.993 --> 49:29.804
Jews from Holland, from Germany, from Czechoslovakia. They didn't know that eh this is a killing place.

49:29.804 --> 49:39.522
So arrived and pretty soon the German eh Frenzel, which who, who I met after the war and spoke with him,

49:39.522 --> 49:48.867
had a interview with him. And he start to yell women and children one side, men down other side. And

49:48.867 --> 49:58.678
he separated. I was with my mother at that time, I said, eh, said goodbye to my mother and I, eh, feeling

49:58.678 --> 50:08.209
that I had a better chance as a man, I went to the men. And later when the division was completed, the

50:08.209 --> 50:18.020
women and children were ordered to go further on. It was about 200 meters. Eh and eh, was a small closing

50:18.020 --> 50:27.365
behind the barbwires over there, also eh gr, green, interwoven with pine branches, where you can't

50:27.365 --> 50:36.709
see the, what's going behind. And the man was, eh were still standing and he start to ask eh about

50:36.709 --> 50:46.053
eh to the crowd about that they need some people in that time because a lot of us committed suicide.

50:46.053 --> 50:55.678
He start to ask who is a carpenter, who is a mechanic, is a, eh eh whatever that they need. Me, fifteen

50:55.678 --> 51:05.209
years old, fifteen and a half, eh, eh, eh, a boy my age goes to school, so I didn't eh, but I pushed

51:05.209 --> 51:14.740
myself to the front, to this German, tell him eh, begging God he should, take me, he should eh take me

51:14.740 --> 51:24.177
out, the German and finally he did take me out. Said komm eraus du Kleiner. And he included me in the

51:24.177 --> 51:33.708
forty people he selected to work in Sobibor. And this way I worked in Sobibor. My first job was to eh,

51:33.708 --> 51:43.053
eh, first was I, I replaced the, dried out, eh branches, pine branches in the, in the, in the fence.

51:43.053 --> 51:52.397
The second job also was sorting clothing. When after the people went to their death, there were, eh,

51:52.397 --> 52:01.835
eh, mountains of clothings. So I sorted eh pants to pants, jackets to jackets and so on. The last job

52:01.835 --> 52:11.272
was I eh eh, you call me fireman. I did I did, eh, I had a, I had a room like this, bigger, in a big,

52:11.272 --> 52:20.803
had a big oven and I was burning documents. That so was my job. Documents, books, soiled clothing, and

52:20.803 --> 52:30.428
this way there was day after day, was dangerous days eh, as I, eh, always eh fast, schnell and eh there

52:30.428 --> 52:39.865
was a few tragic days. People wonder how could you clean, how could you kill people and impossible to

52:39.865 --> 52:49.303
kill so many people in such a short time. It was pe, it was possible if people didn't know what's

52:49.303 --> 52:58.834
going on. For example a Dutch transport of 3,000 Jews arrived at the train station the, the luggage in

52:58.834 --> 53:08.365
Sobibor, their luggage was taken down, they held, eh, it was a special group of Jews which helped them

53:08.365 --> 53:17.803
to take the baggage down, later they were ordered by Germans to leave the luggage on the platform, it

53:17.803 --> 53:27.241
will be delivered later. And eh, they went further on to a big yard and there They were, eh, oh, they

53:27.241 --> 53:36.585
were eh, they had a sho, eh, the German had a short speech. The German Von Tanik, he's a doctor in

53:36.585 --> 53:46.209
a white uniform, he held a short speech, eh, apologizing for the three day difficult trip, but now they

53:46.209 --> 53:55.834
are here already, take a look, it's beautiful here and eh und eh, because of eh sanitary reasons they

53:55.834 --> 54:05.552
need to have a shower. Please undress yourself, you're going, people undressed and they go to an alley

54:05.552 --> 54:14.896
called Himmelfahrtstrasse, straight to the gas chambers. Before that of course their hair were shorn

54:14.896 --> 54:24.240
and later went down to the gas chambers. Eh, s, eh, went all to the gas chambers and eh, later was a

54:24.240 --> 54:29.566
big scream, slowly, and slowly quiet and they're dead.-

54:29.380 --> 54:31.360
You heard them screaming?

54:31.360 --> 54:38.027
Yeah, and I'm sure eh, screaming , the gas went in that eh last minute, I'm sure the first

54:38.027 --> 54:44.765
minutes, when they, instead of water through the shower head gas did come out I think they were

54:44.765 --> 54:51.574
thinking this was kein, eh, mis eh, mis- malfunction, some, some, to the last minute, I'm sure

54:51.574 --> 54:58.383
they didn't know that it, they, they will to be die, they were there dying actually. And so it

54:58.383 --> 55:04.270
went fast. Three, they killed 3,000 people, take a, three, three hours, four hours.

55:04.270 --> 55:06.030
But the ones who were waiting?

55:06.030 --> 55:06.610
Pardon?

55:06.610 --> 55:09.570
There were people waiting while the others were gassed

55:09.570 --> 55:10.520
When the other were gassed

55:10.520 --> 55:11.220
they couldn't ?

55:11.220 --> 55:12.630
then other people were undressing themselves.

55:12.630 --> 55:14.630
And they could hear the screaming?

55:14.630 --> 55:17.680
Oh yeah! I'm sure. I heard it, in the same place. Decided,

55:17.680 --> 55:20.020
no, what's happened? And they didn't know.

55:20.020 --> 55:21.420
They didn't, they still didn't?

55:21.420 --> 55:28.653
No, no, no way, there was no way to tell them because they wouldn't believe anyway. They just, a few

55:28.653 --> 55:35.674
days ago, they did live in human conditions and are going to the ga, they wouldn't believe it. No

55:35.674 --> 55:42.907
way! As a matter of fact a boy did try to tell and they didn't believe, they went to the German that

55:42.907 --> 55:49.999
the boy is eh telling some absurd. So eh later we just sorted and then finally eh with, with a, with

55:49.999 --> 55:57.019
the Dutch people was like that. Eh before they went to the gas chamber you, eh, we, we cut them the

55:57.019 --> 56:04.040
hair. And the young girls used to say 'oh mister don't, don't, eh, cut too short' and so on

56:04.040 --> 56:11.274
you, Po, was, if it was a Polish transport, the Polish people did know. They didn't play around with

56:11.274 --> 56:18.649
them, we chased them and the Polish eh women, I remember, eh, didn't care how, how you cut their hair,

56:18.649 --> 56:26.095
just they said how could you do it. You'll, you kill too. And things like that. Finally you had arrival

56:26.095 --> 56:33.399
of the Je, eh Russian Jews from the Soviet Union, from Minsk, a lot of former prisoners of war arrived,

56:33.399 --> 56:40.633
Jewish people, recognized as Jews in the POW camp. And eh pretty soon we had military men, because the

56:40.633 --> 56:48.008
Polish Jews we didn't know much about military stuff and now the Russian Jews eh, Frenzel, the German,

56:48.008 --> 56:55.100
took out about seventy people eh from the Strassfolk because he had a lot of work. And he picked out

56:55.100 --> 57:02.404
young people, they were military people, so they had, with them, eh, with the help of them we organized

57:02.404 --> 57:09.850
a revolt, we killed the Nazis, you luring them to different places and there nobody did see and we killed

57:09.850 --> 57:12.120
them, took the pistol, not using

57:12.120 --> 57:12.120
Did you kill yourself? No. Never

57:12.120 --> 57:12.970
Did you help killing?

57:12.970 --> 57:20.710
Yeah, of cou, I did, we lured the Nazis. I went to a, Sessman, I went to him, eh, OberscharfÃ¼hrer,

57:20.710 --> 57:28.451
we fa, we did find a beautiful leather coat in the store room, w, exactly your size. Would you like

57:28.451 --> 57:36.114
to try it on? And they liked stuff like this, he went to this place in the, in the store room and,

57:36.114 --> 57:43.854
while he was trying on, the G, the coat [swallows] putting in the hand, the hand were eh ho, holden

57:43.854 --> 57:51.986
back immediately and he was killed with an axe. And so eh, eh, eh, in, in the, the escape was [swallows]

57:51.986 --> 57:59.570
had two phases. The first phase to kill the, the Nazis. I was going around, another young eh, eh,

57:59.570 --> 58:07.311
eh, another two youngsters were going around looking for the Nazis he, we have seen a one, we start

58:07.311 --> 58:15.052
to lure him. Go there and there, there, there. Practical all, all of them went, were, were asked to

58:15.052 --> 58:22.871
be, I and other people, and the second phase was an open revolt. We had already guns from the kills,

58:22.871 --> 58:30.690
t, SS and if they, in that time was only we yelled hurray, hurray. eh, and we threw ourselves on the

58:30.690 --> 58:38.509
bonfires and the rest of the Germans, and we escaped. According to German report eh 320 escaped. Eh,

58:38.509 --> 58:46.562
but again, you was immediately eh, they chased us, the next day they eh, they did eh grab in the forest

58:46.562 --> 58:54.225
about 100 escapees, only 52 survived. Yeah. That's the whole story. I saw at eh, a Polish farmer

58:54.225 --> 59:01.966
agreed to hide us eh, later he did come with a gun, shot at us, we were three boys and eh, only one

59:01.966 --> 59:05.249
survived for, for, from all of them. Yeah.

59:07.400 --> 59:11.128
When I read your book it's always a hesitation, is this

59:11.128 --> 59:14.400
Pole going to help me or is he going to betray me?

59:14.400 --> 59:20.944
You didn't know what kind door you open. Absolutely, eh, and I suspect most strongly

59:20.944 --> 59:26.881
that Dreszer who went into this house and you were in forest, if you remember,

59:26.881 --> 59:33.045
we were in forest running away from Sobibor an the that he was actual apprehended

59:33.045 --> 59:37.840
in he didn't survive, so he probably was killed by the Poles.

59:39.780 --> 59:40.090
Aha.

59:40.090 --> 59:43.547
Or delivered to the Germans by the Poles. I, I was eh, with

59:43.547 --> 59:46.770
one of the boys, but he was wounded in the finger only.

59:46.770 --> 59:48.110
What was his name?

59:48.110 --> 59:53.310
Schmoel, Schmoel Waiczyn. His brother survived the Soviet Union.

59:53.560 --> 59:59.790
So you were always running for the betrayal of Poles after you came out of the camp?

59:59.790 --> 01:00:06.979
Yes, but they didn't recognize me. I was a few times apprehended by German, eh in

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:14.168
a Jewish section of the town in Izbica, eh only Jews. Mostly the Jews in Izbica, in

01:00:14.168 --> 01:00:21.617
the last months were in the left side of the town. On another side of the road. In the

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:29.240
right side were only Poles in that time. And eh once I was apprehended by German because

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:35.130
I wasn't eh, the star. Are you Jewish? I said no and he went away.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.380
No, but I'm talking about after the war

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:38.990
About what? After the war

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:45.929
Oh, after the war. Yeah. I wouldn't eh risk to go to our village after the war. No, no, n, if

01:00:45.929 --> 01:00:53.088
I went, if they would know I'm Jewish, no way. As a matter sometimes, I was forced to go through

01:00:53.088 --> 01:00:59.590
our village so I was afraid that somebody will recognize me, more than eh, in the war. Eh.. Can you

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:09.795
..in the war, in the war they told oh the Germans have finished the Jew. And now the German as they

01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:19.685
gone, are gonna, still Jews left, so they didn't and a lot, eh I mean, one guy eh could kill

01:01:19.685 --> 01:01:29.050
Jews and next it, but was a man which you did want to help and eh this was a crazy world.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:30.430
Hmhm

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:36.149
But some people risked, my teachers, risked their life actually

01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:40.780
to help me. Two of them were Germans. The teachers.

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.880
Can you, can you tell the story?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:54.850
Eh it's nothing to it, I write about this eh when, when, when we were surrounded in before they took

01:01:54.850 --> 01:02:04.540
us to Sobibor I have seen many Poles looking from the windows, you know, from the, behind the curtains

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:14.135
eh on the market place, where is an, and I have seen s, some that crossed the market place is smiling

01:02:14.135 --> 01:02:23.540
and this teacher, eh, eh, eh, a German, eh Polish ancestry, I mean, German ancestry he went through

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:32.850
the market with his head like that, didn't want to go like that, you could see that he was sorry

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:42.160
for us. It sounded good to smiling, hm, so in, eh besides I went to, when I escaped from Izbica to

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:51.850
Ostica, I was eh, I went to this teacher. Eh Steindl was his name. And he had given me food, he talked

01:02:51.850 --> 01:03:01.255
to me another eh teacher too, at night time, because I did go night time, for, eh looking for food,

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:10.565
that helped me, were Poles which helped me, I wouldn't survive otherwise. Some eh, but a lot eh,

01:03:10.565 --> 01:03:20.920
when another Jews were hidden I did go free in the villages. Eh once, was because my father was a legionnaire

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:30.230
and his friend, so-called Pilsu, PiÅ‚sudski's, that eh, when I told that I'm the, the, the son

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:40.205
of eh Blatt, he did help me. Eh a couple, the Jews were killed in the village, I did run around practical

01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:49.610
open. The eh a car eh, eh, eh that eh grabbed me once, they wanted to grab the Polish organization,

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:53.600
but they let me go. Also because my father

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.580
Because they were also hostile to Germans?

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:07.014
Eh, but my father eh, you see, it was a order from general Grot, he has a head, he was the head of

01:04:07.014 --> 01:04:17.449
the Polish Unterground. It was order, order 116 number that any person eh in the forest or what I,

01:04:17.449 --> 01:04:27.670
eh, eh, any person which has a gun illegally, he's not the partisans, eh, should be considered

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:37.892
an enemy and killed. Was mostly directed, by a lot of historians, in my opinion too, it was all,

01:04:37.892 --> 01:04:48.540
mostly directed for Jews. Because some Jews had guns. To survive, not to rob, to survive, to defend.

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:58.761
So, because this order a lot of Jews were killed. And eh eh I describe everything exactly in the

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:07.280
ja. So how, how is this eh, you go to an organization to rent a place like this?

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.370
Ja.

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.800
You have the number, maybe I should do the same thing.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.300
Yes, I'll give it to you. I'll mail you, I'll mail you.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.328
What I will do, I will put also my house, my apartment

01:05:19.328 --> 01:05:22.020
in Gdansk to rent. Three years that it is empty.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:26.180

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:49.642

01:06:06.528 --> 01:06:14.931
and this part you know, was in Lublin went to my grandparents' house, stood them on, on the door, seen

01:06:14.931 --> 01:06:23.334
a different name on the door, it looked empty ja? Eh, this is also in Lublin, and finally I eh I don't

01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:31.817
know, eh, eh, what will it be, eh, which way, give us are able to exist, aha, they'll go to the kitchen

01:06:31.817 --> 01:06:39.978
and we went to the social kitchen and did eat, then we go to the Catholic monastery, somebody told me

01:06:39.978 --> 01:06:48.461

01:06:48.461 --> 01:06:56.702

01:06:56.702 --> 01:07:05.024
I'm Jewish and here is a monastery, I shouldn't pretend so finally I told the I'm Jewish. And she

01:07:05.024 --> 01:07:13.185
allowed me to eat with the hat and I have still have this eh von, before the war, I, I was eh, I hate

01:07:13.185 --> 01:07:21.507
to go without a hat. A Jew doesn't go without a hat. So she let me sit with the hat, with the hat she

01:07:21.507 --> 01:07:24.820
did give me food over there I did eat and

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.840

Okay

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:09.873
Every night. And it was a shame because here was a, so that, this remember because I was nervous.

01:08:09.873 --> 01:08:16.245
You had to go out and see a truck, a militair trucks and that time we hadn't so many cars

01:08:16.245 --> 01:08:22.898

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:35.854
it in the city, another train, another truck, and you, many times I rode on top of the tru,

01:08:35.854 --> 01:08:42.647
on the, on the train, on the roof of the train. Just watching for the tunnels[grins], shouldn't

01:08:42.647 --> 01:08:47.269
cut my head. So and eh till now, I like to travel. I just running.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:50.850
So you, you started a kind of traveling life?

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:51.570
Pardon?

01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:53.350
You started traveling?

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:53.970
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:56.720
Did you know where you were going to?

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:04.742
No. Only the truck will go to WrocÅ‚aw I go with it to WrocÅ‚aw. Eh here the eh and it was liberated,

01:09:04.742 --> 01:09:11.948
the Russian tanks comes to the village and eh, a Jewish captain of a tank start to talk to me and

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:19.153
finally the tanks had a order to go move out, after the Germans, and I stood on the tank and then

01:09:19.153 --> 01:09:26.284
I didn't want to go down and the captain, you must go down, it's a military vehicle, you, we

01:09:26.284 --> 01:09:33.564
can take it, no, I gonna go on with you and he made me to go down. And I was all disappointed that

01:09:33.564 --> 01:09:40.770
even the Russians didn't want me. [laughs] So anyway, eh and eh, I was running and, always, and

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:48.198
traveling. I feel the best when I travel. And I have find out how, how did he come up with the title

01:09:48.198 --> 01:09:53.770
'Still running'. Did the Poles, I didn't talk about running, nothing.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:56.290
But I haven't read that, read that article.

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:56.700
Eh, eh

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.740
It's in Polish

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.580
too bad we didn't go to my place here.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:01.170
Yeah.

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:01.890
This eh

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:05.788
Yes, but still also the people who look at this video, they

01:10:05.788 --> 01:10:09.620
have not read the article. So you should tell me the story

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.160
Yeah, I have a lot of eh, the, documentaries which I made

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:15.940
Uhuh

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.331
I think they're very good as documentaries, I have it also here.

01:10:19.331 --> 01:10:22.260
Too bad we didn't go to me, I would show it to, to you.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:27.330
Yeah, but if you show a documentary, it's not on the tape

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:27.610
Yeah

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:31.586
I mean, we, we need this okay, so, so you started, let

01:10:31.586 --> 01:10:35.490
us start again. You started running, running, running

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:36.210
Yeah

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:38.020
And you ended up in the United States

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:38.220
Yeah.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:38.570
How

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:48.411
I went from Poland to Israel and from the emp, in Israel I met American tourist, a Jew, and she took

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:58.154
me to America. In America I worked the factory, till I learned the language later opened electronic

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:08.488
store in three cities, Santa Barbara but I had one thing always in my mind, to write my memories, finish,

01:11:08.488 --> 01:11:18.231
publish a book, made a film and that actual what I have done. And this is my testament, how would I

01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:28.073
say. My will. This are mine, message, my book. What could happened if we are negligent to understand

01:11:28.073 --> 01:11:38.210
the political movement, eh, actions you, you fail to understand the signs, the marks for for, of coming

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:49.134
, a coming Holocaust. Israel is scaring me a lot. First of all, right or wrong, but is generating anti-Semitism

01:11:49.134 --> 01:11:59.173
in the world, strong anti-Semitism. What do you want? Poland, the biggest anti-Semitism, anti-Semitism

01:11:59.173 --> 01:12:09.113
is in eh, in the Catholic countries. What do you expect? Eh, as I said before a kid growing up seeing

01:12:09.113 --> 01:12:19.053
on the wall a cross and Jesus nailed down on the cross, daddy what is it? Oh this is a cross. And who

01:12:19.053 --> 01:12:28.993
is on the cross? Jesus. And why is this? Because Jews sacrificed him. This is it. This will be a mark

01:12:28.993 --> 01:12:39.031
till the end of his, this kid's life is a, the, the, the seeds of anti-Semitism. Either I hate Jews,

01:12:39.031 --> 01:12:48.873
they killed Jesus. I will kill the Jews because they killed Jesus. Ready answer. So and eh, the, but

01:12:48.873 --> 01:12:58.911
Jesus teach love you, each other, forget this eh guild is on, people don't think about this. But the

01:12:58.911 --> 01:13:02.749
Jews killed Jesus he will grow with it.

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:06.635
But you have this message to the world, but you were running,

01:13:06.635 --> 01:13:09.820
you never settled down, you never married, family?

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:20.293
Yeah, I'm married, yeah, and I divorced, I divorce. I was with one wife eh twenty years

01:13:20.293 --> 01:13:30.060
and another one twenty years. Very honest, twenty years with one girl, oh. [laughs]

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:30.150
Enormous

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:33.050
[laughs] It's okay, ai, twenty years! Long time.

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:35.530
And during that time you were still running?

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:36.190
Pardon?

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:43.580
During that time, you were still running? During the time you were married, you were still running?

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.900
The whole time? Yeah, every year, I, I did need to go to Poland.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.620
Oh you want to go to Poland then?

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.320
Yeah.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.240
And you immediately started to go back to Sobibor or?

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.284
Yeah, in the 1944. The war was still going on. And I

01:13:58.284 --> 01:14:01.270
have pictures which are made eh in that time. Yeah.
You went back to Sobibor?
Yeah.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.940
What did you find?

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:15.733
On that time you could find the hair still because they st, just put sand over it and they made it

01:14:15.733 --> 01:14:28.129
nice, but later the Poles start to dig and they dig out hair and different stuff. I have my own museum,

01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:39.802
a lot of stuff. Which I must send to Yad Vashem as artifacts and melted eh railroad tracks, I was

01:14:39.802 --> 01:14:51.355
in Lublin, I went back to the farmer with the Russians, eh, soldiers, a few officers and we took

01:14:51.355 --> 01:15:03.029
back, we want to kill the farmer as orders. Either he did hide or his wife said he was in another

01:15:03.029 --> 01:15:15.063
town. We didn't find him. But we did find the money. Took back the money. And I did live from this

01:15:15.063 --> 01:15:26.616
money for a while. Later I was an eh eh, a, a personal manager in, first I, I was walking in the

01:15:26.616 --> 01:15:34.799
Polish security eh looking for Germans for hiding eh SS. In Silesia.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.940
Yeah

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:44.860
And eh later I was studying and later they threw me out from the studies and I was working as a social

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:53.781
director in a resort place and later Gemulka did come to power and he told every Jew could move out if

01:15:53.781 --> 01:16:02.701
he want to, to Israel. In 1957 I applied for eh a visa to leave Israel, to live, leave Poland and then

01:16:02.701 --> 01:16:11.796
they give me the visa, I went to Israel. In Israel I picked up my manuscript which was send eh with the,

01:16:11.796 --> 01:16:20.542
the, di, diplomatical post to eh Israel. There I wasn't able to take it out with the train, when I

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:29.463
left. In eh Israel I met eh, eh, my eh future wife, Dina, American, she and we were together for about

01:16:29.463 --> 01:16:38.470
twenty years. Until we divorced. I have a son and my daughter, grandchildren and I have here a daughter

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:47.216
and two grandchildren and two grand grandchildren. [grins] And eh I eh was successful in business. I

01:16:47.216 --> 01:16:56.311
did always want to leave something more tangible for the future, because I felt I have something always,

01:16:56.311 --> 01:17:05.319
I can't die with this, so wrote the books. I had a film. And actually, that what I had planned is it,

01:17:05.319 --> 01:17:14.152
is already done. I have done it. In my small way. If you can't do something the big way, you do the

01:17:14.152 --> 01:17:23.248
small way. That's what I've done and eh, eh I hope my, what I leave, historians will use it and they

01:17:23.248 --> 01:17:32.256
will see the picture how, what's happened a long time ago. Because the murderers are still alive. The

01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:41.614
victims are still alive, you know, they're dying. Eh, that what's happened when the Holocaust happened.

01:17:41.614 --> 01:17:50.622
And the worst of it which make me real upset, is in Poland, where things happen, which takes only a few

01:17:50.622 --> 01:17:59.630
eh, eh, a few eh, hours travel to Auschwitz, to different places to see what's true. Even here, there

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:08.463
are people denied. Eh professor Wende, that Nazis had swimming pools and so on, and so on, and so on,

01:18:08.463 --> 01:18:17.208
that the prisons had regular visits to the swimming pool. This is life, you can do it different way.

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:26.041
De, democracy is sometime, eh, dangerous. It's giving people freedom a freedom also to lie, to hate

01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:34.962
eh, t, eh, eh, dictatorship, if you say good dictator, dicta, dictator maybe it's not so bad. So but

01:18:34.962 --> 01:18:43.707
eh otherwise eh I'm not afraid of the leftist I'm not afraid of rightist, the most critical part

01:18:43.707 --> 01:18:52.540
is the middle that depends on innocent and people will, will go, to the left or to the right. This is

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.290
important. Eh in our

01:18:54.290 --> 01:19:02.660
But Toivi, you told me that one moment you got very angry with the inscription in Sobibor

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:05.520
Eh, they here were killed eh two hundred

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:05.630
Yeah

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.740
the

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:08.220
No, what is the first time you did

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:13.464
In, than , was I, eh, was angry, I was mad, they are lying. It was eh, it was

01:19:13.464 --> 01:19:18.980
a, eh time when everything was a lie in eh, in Auschwitz too. They didn't speak

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:24.497
about Jews, they speak of eh Czech, so many Czech did they kill, so many eh Poles

01:19:24.497 --> 01:19:28.720
were killed, eh, it was difficult to find a sign Jews. Because

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.540
So which period was this? Was it in the sixties?

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.410
Pardon?

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:34.400
In which year

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:41.603
In which year? Eh, all the time, until the new solidarity era. So eh so I felt s, the

01:19:41.603 --> 01:19:48.638
ambassador of everything, I went to the minister, she had talked to the minister of

01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:54.910
culture, minister of religion, oh yes, yes Mr. Blatt eh do hear telephone?

01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:56.120
No, I don't

01:19:56.450 --> 01:20:03.973
Oh yes, yes, Mr. Blatt, we will eh, eh, do, we look, so final I thought I must do it a different way.

01:20:03.973 --> 01:20:11.200
And I went to the kitchen, I went to the local dignitaries from Wlodawa eh? And they did help me.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.320
Tell me?

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:19.066
Yeah, I need to give some nice gifts to them and, and one day I've done it. I don't

01:20:19.066 --> 01:20:24.615
want to talk about it much because the people are still alive and I could hurt them,

01:20:24.615 --> 01:20:30.295
but b, mention their names, but the day, every day I help, I was able to take down the

01:20:30.295 --> 01:20:35.250
sign, the old one, I still have it in Poland hidden, the old sign, that one.
You still have it?

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:44.670
Yeah, that 250, fifty eh Russians were killed. So I have it hidden. And eh

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:48.620
So what does the sign say? 250 Russians were killed here?

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:50.300
Russians, with

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.270
and 250

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:59.887
big letters, I have in my, my, you don't have it, it is another book, they let us, and

01:20:59.887 --> 01:21:07.820
Poles, Jews, gypsies in small, tiny letters. But fat letters do say 250 Russians.

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.580
250,000 or 250

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.180
Yes, 250,000

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:09.740
Okay, okay.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:18.184
Anyway, so I took it down and eh, for a lot of money, because I did need to do it fast or while the,

01:21:18.184 --> 01:21:26.966
eh atmosphere is okay, and I spent about 14,000 dollars or 12,000 dollars for signs to make it overnight

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:35.748
practically. In Polish, in eh in eh in German, in French, in Dutch. With the Dutch sign I made a mistake

01:21:35.748 --> 01:21:42.250
which are, the ambassador called me later I should correct it. [sighs] Anyway

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:43.670
You made a new sign?

01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:45.370
I made these new signs now.

01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:45.870
Good

01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:51.962
And eh I put it in and it will stay although I finally missed this point probably I, I wouldn't

01:21:51.962 --> 01:21:57.991
able to change it, we need to go the commissions and the minister of culture and here and there,

01:21:57.991 --> 01:22:02.890
I've done it and it is, it will stay that way, nobody will take it down now.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:06.540
Hm

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:10.620
The half of people, Germans, were very sympathetic to my

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.430
When did this co, idea come into your mind?

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:15.490
When?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.720
Did this idea come to you to do this?

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:25.940
Idea?

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:26.270
Yeah, when, wanneer, kamm es in Ihren Kopf?

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.680
Ja, when?

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.960
When yes?

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.720
When? Now, years ago?

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.200
Yes, years ago

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.350
When, nothing eh, eh, the war time had to survive.
Yes?

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:43.487
And I put it in my book, the first thing. It's a sort of survival. Was, has nothing to do with

01:22:43.487 --> 01:22:53.414
Judaism, has not, I was a Jew but I need to hide, I didn't think, just think how to survive.

01:22:53.414 --> 01:23:03.341
Eh no political reasons, no this to survive. Now eh Jewish, no? My mother used to say does it,

01:23:03.341 --> 01:23:13.162
is it worth it to give a lie six million, in that time did they not even know six million, to

01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:23.194
give a life just to be Jews. Every generation practically did they kill Jews. They ke, they say

01:23:23.194 --> 01:23:31.220
that eh how many years ago, I forgot, there were as much Jews as eh British.

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.420
Uhuh

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:42.627
But it is eh, now 90 or 70 million and Jews are still fourteen because they fall out, anyway, I thought

01:23:42.627 --> 01:23:51.388
that eh religions on eh far away now. I, I don't believe the, I believe that it was written by a

01:23:51.388 --> 01:24:00.507
bunch of uneducated people, maybe smart, maybe intelligent, stories about eh, eh frozen eh salt, about

01:24:00.507 --> 01:24:09.178
this, that eh, eh, I still believing in this stories, but eh, I am a Jew, a national, I would say

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:17.849
I'm an, a, a nationalistic Jew. I know I am a Jew, the point is this, that the eh, the Bible is

01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:26.700
the Jewish history. Can not go away from it. Eh you are in a way religious if you eh believe in the

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:35.371
history of Jewish history and then, I was thinking, eh, I had a Polish eh girlfriend and she want

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:44.042
I should convert. To Christianity which to marry her. Because her mother wouldn't allow it. And

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:52.714
I was surrendered to do it. But later I thought, hell, I'm Jewish, generations, of, generations

01:24:52.714 --> 01:25:01.653
survived till now being Jewish, didn't give up and I'm o, the only one left von der family, long

01:25:01.653 --> 01:25:10.593
family, eh, if I give up, Hitler has another victim. No. I told them sorry but I'm Jew, I am a Jew

01:25:10.593 --> 01:25:19.533
and will stay a Jew. If you don't want to, sorry. So, but I feel eh n, nationalistic, I'm a Jew,

01:25:19.533 --> 01:25:28.472
I wouldn't give up eh, eh, eh, eh, feel, many Jews bef, before me suffered and I should be the one

01:25:28.472 --> 01:25:37.144
to close the, the, the, the, the saga of the Blatt's? Nein! No. That's all. Eh, analyzing the

01:25:37.144 --> 01:25:45.815
past life, I, I'm still in Sobibor. And the dreams. And the dreams I were logical, in the pain,

01:25:45.815 --> 01:25:54.576
and become scared and very real. No wonder when I wake up finally eh and I go eat breakfast I want

01:25:54.576 --> 01:26:03.337
to go back to bed. Because the dreams, although I sleep good, but they eh finishing me. And when I

01:26:03.337 --> 01:26:07.360
get up, eat a little, want to go back to bed.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.440
Really?

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:15.944
Yeah and I could sleep till three o'clock. And later, but after, afternoon late I get, I feel

01:26:15.944 --> 01:26:23.527
good, feel strength. Otherwise eh I still now, I'm tired, and the dreams always eh, one thing,

01:26:23.527 --> 01:26:31.269
that I had the chance to survive, I had a chance to escape from Sobibor, once the guards they look

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:39.010
some place else and I could run in the forest because I walk in the forest and I don't do it and

01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:46.831
later the Germans come to kill me and this is the end and I'm sorry I didn't escape and another

01:26:46.831 --> 01:26:54.414
dream is that they forced assessment in Sobibor, Wagner send me out to the city of Lublin to buy

01:26:54.414 --> 01:27:02.155
something and I figure out, oh now it's time to escape but he expect me back in an hour, eh, eh,

01:27:02.155 --> 01:27:09.739
while the eh, eh, rol-call will take place twelve o'clock. So I figure out now is eleven, till

01:27:09.739 --> 01:27:17.954
I go to the train station will take fifteen minutes and I need that train who will, eh leave immediately

01:27:17.954 --> 01:27:25.854
and I figure out I will not manage to leave fifty kilometers past eh Lublin because they will notice

01:27:25.854 --> 01:27:33.990
in a, in about an hour I'm not there and they will probably notify all the police. Anyway, everything

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:41.889
is logical I think. And I decide to go back to Sobibor. And again they come to kill us all and again

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:49.394
I'm sorry I didn't take the chance. Things like that which is eh maybe he did put it right,

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:52.080
the journalist, eh still escaping.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.840
You spoke once with Frenzel, when did you speak with Frenzel?

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:02.730
In 1963 I think. Or '64 or '66.
What happened?
Pardon?

01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:06.940
What happened? What did he say? What did you discuss?

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:14.027
Eh we discussed, we didn't discuss, I wrote in that time one of my books.

01:28:14.027 --> 01:28:19.421
Eh, one is my biography eh From the Ashes of Sobibor the other one, the

01:28:19.421 --> 01:28:23.980
Sobibor, the Forgotten Revolt, is a sort of the revolt only.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.640
Hmhm

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:39.844
And I did want to know, because I was allowed eh to be in, eh to go to see the Lager 1, Lager 2. I was

01:28:39.844 --> 01:28:49.268
not allowed to go l, to Lager 3, nobody at first. Lager 3 was the place where the gas chamber was. Was

01:28:49.268 --> 01:28:58.693
closed down with a special fence . In Lager 3 they gassed and they burned the people. Eh so, but I did

01:28:58.693 --> 01:29:08.672
want to write my book and t, Frenzel didn't know what's going on. [coughs] Although I, being in Sobibor,

01:29:08.672 --> 01:29:18.004
It was always eh, eh, interesting, how would I say, I did want to know what's happened and how this

01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:27.243
machine works. In a minute as I took a risk and I did go and check over the here and there, eh so eh

01:29:27.243 --> 01:29:37.130
Frenzel was sentenced to life in prison. After sixteen years in jail his lawyer did find some discrepancies

01:29:37.130 --> 01:29:46.554
between testimony of two witnesses and on this basis he did, his lawyer did win a retrial. Frenzel's

01:29:46.554 --> 01:29:55.794
retrial. But, so Frenzel delivered was in Hannover and he eh when the court session where he was eh,

01:29:55.794 --> 01:30:05.496
he did come to Hagen, when the cou, where the court w, eh take place and from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

01:30:05.496 --> 01:30:14.735
he went to the court. In that time they called me as a witness. So I testified against him and so on

01:30:14.735 --> 01:30:24.252
and he did live, eh, eh, he had, he lived in a, eh, in a motel eh, the same street I did live in Hagen.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:33.492
So I wrote down about 17 questions and asked a friend of mine to eh go to Frenzel, he lives here not

01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:43.009
far and try to get an answer for the questions for my book. And he left. And a few minutes later I have

01:30:43.009 --> 01:30:52.341
a phone call from him, Toivi I want to talk to you. A, at that point I didn't know what to, what to

01:30:52.341 --> 01:31:01.765
do because eh going to him I'm making him again a person. If I talk to him he can't be so bad. Eh,

01:31:01.765 --> 01:31:11.190
that he picked me up when selected me to work, it's not because I should live, because I should work

01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:20.707
over there and the time will come and he could kill me the same way. What I was thinking? With the time

01:31:20.707 --> 01:31:29.946
I will be gone, my friends will be gone who could point a finger ha, eh my friends from Sobibor, how

01:31:29.946 --> 01:31:39.740
could you do that, eh, Frenzel will be gone but history is history. I go to him and I don't care because

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:49.165
I will do my part for the history. And this is important because never happened till now that a victim

01:31:49.165 --> 01:31:51.660
should talk direct with the

01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.790
Incredible, incredible

01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:59.575
so, do you see the picture? And I did go and I remember, eh, I agree we, we talk to him

01:31:59.575 --> 01:32:06.283
in the lobby. And I remember opening the door, he was sitting at that table like this,

01:32:06.283 --> 01:32:12.990
a bottle of beer, and my German friend Kurtz Bockman was sitting here, I went over and

01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:19.854
oh he stood up, he clicked his heels like a officer should do and my, he, I think he did

01:32:19.854 --> 01:32:26.484
want to give me, he would shake my hand. And he, and I ask him, Frenzel, you remember

01:32:26.484 --> 01:32:32.100
me? He looks and he answered me like that, no, you was just a little boy

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:33.280
[laughs]

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.420
No, and I remember, was a little boy. We did talk about four hours.
And what did he tell?

01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:45.611
But he said, eh, he said eh, sorry, but I know you can't forgive me eh, and, but I said

01:32:45.611 --> 01:32:53.003
I can't one thing understand, understand, reading now about Israel how they fight the

01:32:53.003 --> 01:32:59.630
Arabs, how they win, I can't understand why you did make the revolt earlier.

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:00.740
He didn't understand

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:06.900
Yeah. Eh, you, you fight, you were, and it was things like that, we talk and eh, it was all about

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.360
What did you answer?

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:08.780
Pardon?

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.110
What did you answer?

01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:11.630
What I did answer?

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.000
Yes

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.250
Oh, I did answer, it was different times, there were four years eh Just in the dirt, step down, our

01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:28.416
spirit was broken eh, that eh they lied and get the, the, the, always said we survive, the hell we

01:33:28.416 --> 01:33:36.583
will survive and eh, anyway, I don't remember exactly, I have it written down, but eh, we talked

01:33:36.583 --> 01:33:44.583
for a long time. As I ask him if he was sorry and so on, why don't you go, because of a lot of

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:52.750
people say it never happened to him, why don't you go and say I was there, I have done, done it,

01:33:52.750 --> 01:34:01.000
I was a part. So he answered me, oh, you know, I can't. you see here, here, here, in the big jobs

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:09.000
there are still Nazis. And If I go and, and talk a, eh, eh, like that, eh, I would, I wouldn't

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.250
manage. Something like this, and later [sighs] of course I left and he left

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.300
Hm

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:20.590
Yeah

01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:22.110
Were you angry?

01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:22.810
Pardon?

01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:25.650
Were you angry with him, were, did you hate him?

01:34:25.650 --> 01:34:33.513
You see, I wasn't angry. I didn't feel anything. Because if I would have some feelings, I wouldn't

01:34:33.513 --> 01:34:40.696
be able to talk to him. Some friends of mine said, oh, from Sobibor, I would kill him, I would,

01:34:40.696 --> 01:34:47.879
I'm eh, would kill, we could kill him when he was in court, many of who survives was in court

01:34:47.879 --> 01:34:55.364
cursing him. It's good if they kill him. If I kill him, let's say, I go to jail. If I got, got,

01:34:55.364 --> 01:35:02.699
eh, to jail, who would suffer? My family would suffer, my children would, eh, co, and my children

01:35:02.699 --> 01:35:10.033
would consider me me, a murderer, a different times. Besides, killing somebody is nothing. It's

01:35:10.033 --> 01:35:17.443
very easy to kill, it's very difficult to live I would say [grins] So eh eh, so I've done the,

01:35:17.443 --> 01:35:24.701
but I think still, till now, done the best of it, I did eh eh put my little thing to history eh,

01:35:24.701 --> 01:35:31.884
if he, if Frenzel would, giving mostly technical, had a, Gazkammer, eh, gas chamber works , eh,

01:35:31.884 --> 01:35:39.521
eh, is only for, for, for his, historians for researchers. Eh I will have time, I will write a little

01:35:39.521 --> 01:35:47.309
bit more, because I spent, I met eh this year the brother, one of the murders who we killed, Vallaster,

01:35:47.309 --> 01:35:54.568
we killed him in the, when we revolted. But his brother has come to Sobibor and I met him there.

01:35:54.568 --> 01:35:57.289
He asked for forgiveness. This year.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.800
Really?

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:07.142
Yeah, this year. So eh and I'm still digging in the papers, but I'm already, I, I want to finish

01:36:07.142 --> 01:36:15.152
my third book because I think it's b, it's more interesting in, interesting, it's, is very

01:36:15.152 --> 01:36:23.328
interesting because when before all my energy, everything was directed in surviving after the war,

01:36:23.328 --> 01:36:31.671
completely different issues that pop out. What shall I do, shall I go studying, I was too impatient,

01:36:31.671 --> 01:36:39.930
I was always on the run. Eh it's like I want to free myself from the, from the fences of Sobibor.

01:36:39.930 --> 01:36:48.190
Eh, now, political reasons, their party and one way the party is hating Jews and killing Jews. They

01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:53.530
killed the leader of the revolt in Lublin after the war. So they

01:36:53.530 --> 01:36:55.510
You mean the communists?

01:36:55.650 --> 01:36:59.670
No, not the communists. The opposite Nationalists.

01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:00.840
Okay, sorry, young Nationalists

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:10.705
Yeah. Eh, and eh so eh you did look for, for a safety place, was a political party PPR which apply,

01:37:10.705 --> 01:37:20.272
eh, eh, take in Jews. So I did go there. And eh later I did eh want to take some revenge in, eh,

01:37:20.272 --> 01:37:30.038
I walked in the, in our section I think, section four of five, eh looking for the Nazis. And later

01:37:30.038 --> 01:37:39.506
I escaped from Poland, come back to Pol, from Ll with the Polish ? come back to Poland and they

01:37:39.506 --> 01:37:47.080
say you escaped from Poland. And I, just find my way, my way to, to America.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:54.000
What do you expect from the Demjanjuk trial?

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.160
[sighs] Demjanjuk trial. Demjanjuk got a couple of arguments. One of

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.881
the arguments is take a look. They let, there was eh, eh, comma, eh,

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:13.350
eh were c, c, criminal proceedings against the men from Trawniki.

01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:15.200
Yeah.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.540
They let free. The commandant of Trawniki.

01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:18.000
Yeah

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:26.164
The commandant they let free. I was over there only eh, eh, guard. Why do you suing me? They let free

01:38:26.164 --> 01:38:34.410
the commandant. Then other argument would be, now that's in Trawniki, I know in Trawniki they killed

01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:42.332
Jews too, but there were no gas chambers. So they sent him to, to eh, Sobibor. Now here everything

01:38:42.332 --> 01:38:48.880
takes in different dimension. A guard actually is the lowest rank in the, eh, eh,..
Yeah

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:57.741
..in the army. A guard in concentration camp, in a jail, is standing guard so the prisoner

01:38:57.741 --> 01:39:06.401
should not escape. But a guard in Sobibor, a death camp, was a chain in, was a link in

01:39:06.401 --> 01:39:15.363
the chain. And they did, he worked, helping to kill the Jews. The seventeen Germans which

01:39:15.363 --> 01:39:22.110
were over there in that time, they wouldn't be able to kill 3,000

01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:22.370
Exactly

01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:30.531
Dutch, but [finger on table] they were the murderers. He is a murderer. That's all. But, but

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:39.126
again, the point is this, that all, why did it n, eh, in, in the Sobibor trial for killing 130,000,

01:39:39.126 --> 01:39:47.114
three years, what is this, it's nothing. Eh, but, eh but eh, in that time there were still

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:55.276
the old Nazis, they were still the old Nazis eh in power and there were charges and than . Now

01:39:55.276 --> 01:40:03.437
is a different generation. This don't answer why I long time ago where his sentence is very,

01:40:03.437 --> 01:40:11.425
very, very, very little though. So now I don't know. I think that eh he will be considered

01:40:11.425 --> 01:40:19.499
guilty but because he was already in jail, the eh will let him spend the rest of his years in

01:40:19.499 --> 01:40:27.400
home arrest. Could be. Because to America he can't go back. He does have, he has lost his

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:35.735
citizenship so that's all we could do. Why? I guess I remember him?. No. How could I remember,

01:40:35.735 --> 01:40:39.989
when I don't I remember the face of my parents?

01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:48.763
Now if a thought , if he was in that time when I was in Sobibor, he is a murderer, I have

01:40:48.763 --> 01:40:57.636
seen them, I have seen them pushing the people to the gas chambers, not direct, but I went

01:40:57.636 --> 01:41:05.030
on to eh, about five meters before the gas chamber was the cutting barracks

01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:07.680
Exactly, thanks

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.590
Yeah.
