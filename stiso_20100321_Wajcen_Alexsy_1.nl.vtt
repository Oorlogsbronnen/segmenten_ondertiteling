I want to ask him, in 39 he did see the Soviet Army coming?

15:04.430 --> 15:06.790
In the year of 39, did you see how the Soviet eh-eh-eh

15:06.790 --> 15:10.490
Yes. In the year of 39 we lived. Until the year of 39

15:10.490 --> 15:10.490
You lived? In Poland?

15:10.490 --> 15:10.490
In Poland

15:10.490 --> 15:16.640
Did you see the Soviets, as they came, when the Army, when

15:16.640 --> 15:18.760
As Poland [unclear] came into

15:18.760 --> 15:33.910
How did the process of changeover from Poles to Russians pass? How did that process proceed?

15:33.910 --> 15:34.770
The process? Proceeded normally

15:34.770 --> 15:35.610
Normally?

15:35.610 --> 15:35.860
Normally

15:35.860 --> 15:38.736
Proceeded normally? He’s saying, the process of the Soviets

15:38.736 --> 15:41.330
coming in was normal, I’m just trying to think it out

15:43.890 --> 15:45.430
I understand

15:45.430 --> 15:45.720
Yeah

15:45.720 --> 15:48.640
This is my historical knowledge. I understand.

15:48.890 --> 15:49.280
Ok

15:49.280 --> 15:56.789
And how did he get into the army? Did he get a letter or did he

15:56.789 --> 16:04.180
go himself to the army? So, how did he land to be in the army?

16:04.180 --> 16:08.048
How did you become a military man, did you received a letter, an invitation

16:08.048 --> 16:11.660
or did you decide by yourself – I want to be in the Army? Or how you

16:11.660 --> 16:14.670
No, the army incorporated

16:14.670 --> 16:16.710
Regulated by law at the age of 18

16:16.710 --> 16:16.710
Regulated by law, yes

16:16.710 --> 16:16.710
18 years law

16:16.710 --> 16:21.880
Regulated by the law of the Soviet Union at the age of 18

16:21.880 --> 16:25.500
There was a law in the Soviet Union- at 18 you had to

16:25.500 --> 16:32.370
And where did he go when he went to the army?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.745
And where did you go, what was your first step into the Army, where

16:35.745 --> 16:38.610
did you have to go? Where did you start to be a military man?

16:38.610 --> 16:41.000
Where did you start to serve during the first days of the Army?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.380
The first days I served in Hodorov

16:43.790 --> 16:46.050
In Hodorov?

16:46.050 --> 16:47.320
In Hodyr, Hodyr

16:47.320 --> 16:47.730
Yes

16:47.730 --> 16:59.080
Did he get a letter to go there?

16:59.080 --> 17:04.887
Did you received a letter as you had become 18 – you have to serve

17:04.887 --> 17:09.670
or you just knew – have to, have to go to some office?

17:09.670 --> 17:10.790
To the army, how was you, they issued a summons?[ Grandfather?

17:10.790 --> 17:21.490
Ah? Did they issue a summons to go to the Army on you?

17:21.490 --> 17:22.770
Issued a summons, yes

17:22.770 --> 17:27.100
He received an official letter. Yes, he received the official letter

17:27.100 --> 17:29.780
Was he scared of the Germans at that time?

17:29.780 --> 17:39.760
At that time were you afraid of the Germans? Or not? At that time?

17:39.760 --> 17:47.320
As you were leaving to the Army? Before the war. Were you scared of the Germans?

17:47.320 --> 17:47.840
I was scared, people were always scared

17:47.840 --> 17:47.840
Were scared?

17:47.840 --> 17:47.840
Yes

17:47.840 --> 17:47.840
Were scared, yes?

17:47.840 --> 17:53.090
In the year of 40?

17:53.090 --> 17:53.090
In 40? In 39

17:53.090 --> 17:57.930
No, as you were called into the Army, were you scared of the Germans?

17:57.930 --> 17:58.500
Yes, yes

17:58.500 --> 17:58.870
Were scared?

17:58.870 --> 18:04.820
He was called in the army in 40, and yes, he was afraid of them

18:04.820 --> 18:05.620
Of the Germans?

18:05.620 --> 18:06.240
Yes

18:06.240 --> 18:08.150
He knew, what the Germans were doing already?

18:08.150 --> 18:16.447
Had you already understood what kind of people they were, those

18:16.447 --> 18:24.350
Nazis, had you understood something about them to that time?

18:24.350 --> 18:29.279
To that time you had already heard about what Hitler was

18:29.279 --> 18:34.120
doing? In the Soviet Union and in the world in general?

18:34.120 --> 18:39.360
I heard at our place: the German attacked the Soviet Union

18:39.360 --> 18:42.570
But it was in 41

18:42.570 --> 18:43.320
In 41

18:43.320 --> 18:46.170
And in 40 you came to serve into the Army, did you heard what Hitler was doing?

18:46.170 --> 18:46.170
Came, we were summoned to the Army

18:46.170 --> 18:49.510
But did you know about it?

18:50.110 --> 18:51.470
I knew

18:51.470 --> 18:59.120
That Hitler got the war started?

18:59.120 --> 18:59.510
Yes

18:59.510 --> 19:00.790
Hitler is going to Europe? He knew

19:00.790 --> 19:06.799
How did you know about the things Hitler had done? How you? Did you hear from

19:06.799 --> 19:12.730
other people? I’m trying to ask to, how he knew about, about the nature of

19:12.730 --> 19:14.670
People talked under themselves, told everything, that the German attacked, knew everything

19:14.670 --> 19:14.670
People were talking?

19:14.670 --> 19:14.790
Were talking

19:14.790 --> 19:26.361
So, do you actually need him to say There were conversations,

19:26.361 --> 19:33.760
there were rumors and there was enough?

19:34.280 --> 19:38.780
So, was he motivated to go in the Soviet Army to fight Hitler?

19:38.780 --> 19:40.430
So, as you knew and suspected that you knew about Hitler, were you motivated to be

19:40.430 --> 19:42.040
a soviet soldier, so you could fight with him? Was it a good motivation for you?

19:42.040 --> 19:45.260
I was summoned Well, how should I say

19:45.260 --> 19:46.460
Responsibility, responsibility

19:46.460 --> 19:51.530
Responsibility. That was regulated by law, we had to serve in the Soviet Army

19:51.530 --> 19:51.530
You felt you had to, didn´t you?

19:51.530 --> 20:06.787
No, I don´t feel that assurance in me – well, you have to go, so to say, responsibility.

20:06.787 --> 20:19.530
Because the German was tough, the German was. And the Jewish were halfupper?

20:20.450 --> 20:21.400
[Whisper on the background]

20:21.400 --> 20:42.469
There is the other side of the question. How did you see it, so the life, you

20:42.469 --> 21:03.538
started your life and lived, before the army you lived in Poland, how did you

21:03.538 --> 21:24.059
sensed serving the Soviet Union in the ranks of the soviet military forces?

21:24.060 --> 21:26.250
In the ranks of the soviet army, sure, they lived better. They lived better, in freedom

21:26.250 --> 21:26.250
You lived better?

21:26.250 --> 21:28.820
Before the German occupied the territory which he

21:32.570 --> 21:39.996
I would like to ask Mr. Waitsen – he went into the army and he

21:39.996 --> 21:47.190
met many people who were not Jewish. How was life in the army?

21:47.190 --> 21:47.590
How?

21:47.880 --> 21:53.837
She would like to ask to Mr. Waitsen: You served in the Army, and how

21:53.837 --> 21:59.450
did you get acquainted there with many people, who were not Jews?

21:59.450 --> 22:04.890
How was your collective life in the Army?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.970
The army was good

22:09.970 --> 22:12.790
The Army was good

22:12.790 --> 22:21.040
German, Polish – it didn´t matter

22:21.040 --> 22:24.870
The German-Polish relations were good in your Army

22:24.870 --> 22:26.070
Yes. Very good

22:26.070 --> 22:28.480
There were good relations in the army. Normal

22:28.480 --> 22:28.480
Normal

22:28.480 --> 22:37.677
Normal relations between the Jews and not-Jews. So, that

22:37.677 --> 22:46.710
you are a Jew, and there were others, who were not Jews

22:46.710 --> 22:59.060
And at one stage, when the war started, what happened with him, did he fight during the war?

22:59.060 --> 22:59.660
What, what?

22:59.660 --> 23:06.260
As the war begun, did you immediately start to fight or what happ

23:06.260 --> 23:06.840
It means, into the Army and hold

23:06.840 --> 23:06.840
No

23:06.840 --> 23:07.530
Why no?

23:07.530 --> 23:10.720
As the war begun

23:10.720 --> 23:10.790
The war begun, yes

23:10.790 --> 23:12.810
Where did you meet it?

23:12.810 --> 23:40.040

23:40.040 --> 23:40.700
In the army?

23:40.700 --> 23:47.525
He says – in the Soviet Army, 39. As the war started, where were

23:47.525 --> 23:54.040
you at that moment? I’m asking, where he was when the war [?]

23:55.470 --> 23:59.250
Good. Did he have to fight?

23:59.250 --> 24:18.040
Did you fight in the army? Did you have to fight into the army?

24:18.040 --> 24:42.340
I fought in the army

24:42.340 --> 24:42.700

24:42.700 --> 25:02.530
Fought during the time of the soviet army, in the soviet army, in the Soviet Union

25:02.530 --> 25:03.190
[unclear]

25:03.190 --> 25:10.293
We were summoned during the time of the soviet army and we ended with

25:10.293 --> 25:16.470
the soviet army, incorporated with the Red Army incorporated

25:16.470 --> 25:19.850
Fought in the Red Army? Оk, and he fought in the Soviet Army

25:19.850 --> 25:19.850

25:19.850 --> 25:19.850
Eh?

25:19.850 --> 25:19.850
[Telephone is ringing]

25:19.850 --> 25:21.840
When did you become a prisoner, when were you taken into captivity?

25:21.840 --> 25:22.520
I didn´t understand

25:22.520 --> 25:22.520
You became a prisoner, you, you, you a prisoner of war, for you

25:22.520 --> 25:24.220
No, no, no, no. We fought

25:24.620 --> 25:30.278

25:30.278 --> 25:35.720
another question, to further, you remember or not?

25:35.720 --> 25:42.640
Yeah. He was fighting, but at one stage he came to Minsk

25:42.640 --> 25:42.640
[Telephone is ringing]

25:42.640 --> 25:49.970
But to the certain moments you were in Minsk

25:49.970 --> 25:51.890
The Germans caught him

25:55.600 --> 25:56.660
The Germans took you in Minsk, if we well

25:56.660 --> 25:57.590
Yes, that is

25:57.590 --> 25:57.590
Tell

25:57.590 --> 26:16.574
We already served in the Soviet Army and in the Soviet Union. After that

26:16.574 --> 26:34.240
we were taken from the ranks of the Soviet Army, in the Soviet Army

26:34.240 --> 26:34.680

26:55.923 --> 27:09.410

27:18.430 --> 27:19.850
Not in ghetto, in Minsk, and there is no ghetto in Minsk. This is liquidated [unclear] ghetto

27:19.850 --> 27:21.820
He was not in the ghetto

27:21.820 --> 27:26.220
He was not in the ghetto

27:26.220 --> 27:34.440
He was taken into captivity from the ranks of the Soviet Army

27:34.440 --> 27:48.670
From the Soviet Army? He was taking from the ranks of the Soviet Army into prisoner of war?

27:50.530 --> 27:53.190
But he ran away

Did you come to Sobibor by train? Do you remember anything about the train to Sobibor?

32:01.550 --> 32:06.963
To Sobibor? By echelons, we were going by echelons. In Poland

32:06.963 --> 32:11.400
Sobibor and they immediately tugged us to the camp

32:11.400 --> 32:22.750
You were in the echelons? After that out of the train

32:22.750 --> 32:23.750
By train, by train

32:23.750 --> 32:31.070
They went in echelons and they were taken into the camp, in echelons

32:31.070 --> 32:43.110

32:45.490 --> 32:45.490
Not immediately

32:45.490 --> 32:47.180
Not immediately, with the time

32:52.390 --> 32:54.250
What happened first?

32:54.250 --> 33:02.360
What happened there at once?

33:02.360 --> 33:13.530
At once I [?] was not yet. They shot, killed, brought into

33:13.530 --> 33:23.160
the camp andthere were different, different things

33:23.160 --> 33:27.364
At once with many others already They shut many of them right

33:27.364 --> 33:30.880
away, eliminated them. That’s what happened first

33:32.240 --> 33:34.430
And you were elected for work?

33:34.430 --> 33:36.870
And you were elected to work there?

33:36.870 --> 33:46.327
To work, worked, went to clean the street, everything, we cleaned everything.

33:46.327 --> 33:55.785
And then, one beautiful day, there was an order of the city commandant, there

33:55.785 --> 34:02.910
was an order – to summon to the army from then till then

34:02.910 --> 34:07.920
No, about the camp, at the camp already, in Sobibor

34:07.920 --> 34:08.950
In Sobibor? No, in Sobibor they didn´t summon, no

34:08.950 --> 34:13.370

How in Sobibor?

34:15.920 --> 34:16.670
Yes

34:16.670 --> 34:19.860

34:19.860 --> 34:29.350
They eliminated people, they shut them

34:29.350 --> 34:32.280
Where did you work yourself?

34:32.280 --> 34:39.370
I worked on doing cleaning, cleaning premises, cleaning premises, cleaning [unclear]

35:00.700 --> 35:10.447
And your work, you also did cleaning the train, which was used as a transport

35:10.447 --> 35:17.790
means, did you also work there, there are such premises or

35:17.790 --> 35:28.520

35:28.520 --> 35:32.630

No, so to Sobibor was arriving an echelon, did you do cleaning of that platz?

35:38.620 --> 35:42.733
At that time in Sobibor, one time, to the left, to the right,

35:42.733 --> 35:46.510
aimed and that´s it – under the bullet, the execution

35:46.510 --> 35:47.730
And that´s all. You did not meet the train

35:47.730 --> 35:47.730
The train - no

35:47.730 --> 35:48.220
So as on the platform you didn´t meet the train and didn´t clean anything

35:48.220 --> 35:49.320
No, no

35:49.320 --> 35:52.970
He did not clean the trains, he did not meet the trains

35:52.970 --> 35:53.270
He cleaned other places

35:53.270 --> 35:53.270
Yes

35:53.270 --> 35:54.450
What kind of places, please?

36:00.980 --> 36:20.580
No. We immediately into the camp under the bullet, the German – at once, was shooting, killing

36:20.580 --> 36:30.120
In the camp, what kind of work did you do at the camp?

36:30.120 --> 36:30.120
Cleaning harvesting?

36:30.120 --> 36:30.570
In Sobibor?

36:30.570 --> 36:31.070
In Sobibor

36:31.070 --> 36:31.200

36:31.200 --> 36:31.200
Eh?

36:31.200 --> 36:31.570
Cleaning what? What harvesting?

36:31.570 --> 36:32.090
Cleaning the territory

36:32.090 --> 36:32.590

36:40.130 --> 36:53.210
And after that at the camp, what kind of work did you have to do?

36:53.210 --> 37:16.020
Well, that at the German camp, at their place, cleaned that one, they had so to say a law- cleaning

37:16.040 --> 37:31.400
It's difficult to ascertain what he was doing there, cleaning

37:31.890 --> 37:36.760
As you on sorting, they left you there after that?

37:39.690 --> 37:54.060
Yes, there[during 6 moths we were sent into the camp, to clean the camps

37:54.060 --> 37:55.770
To do sorting things

37:55.770 --> 37:56.150
To do sorting, yes

Were you immediately sent to?

37:57.900 --> 37:57.990
No

37:57.990 --> 38:00.110
Before that you

38:01.270 --> 38:02.210
Before that we worked variously

38:02.210 --> 38:02.210
Variously, yes, depended on where you were sent?

38:02.210 --> 38:09.050
He is trying to find out about the selection, whether he was sent somewhere right away or not

38:09.050 --> 38:17.798
It doesn’t make sense, I just wonder, what he was cleaning.

38:17.798 --> 38:24.540
It you? must be much more close to his feelings

38:24.540 --> 38:28.773
Yes Maybe, I will try one more time. He said they cleaned premises.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.870
What kind premises were those – the barracks or

38:31.870 --> 38:43.130
The barracks

38:46.160 --> 38:46.380
The barracks? Cleaning barracks

38:46.380 --> 38:48.960
There were many cleaning tasks in Sobibor

38:48.960 --> 38:50.260
They were there, where they were shooting

38:52.920 --> 38:54.560
They were shooting

38:56.010 --> 38:58.410
It must be a frightful memory

39:01.570 --> 39:03.070
These are awful memories for you

39:03.070 --> 39:08.790
And I sincerely apologize that we are doing this to you, him?

39:08.790 --> 39:18.020

39:20.700 --> 39:21.640
So

39:22.150 --> 39:32.960
Did he have friends in Sobibor, when he finally reached the camp?

39:32.960 --> 39:37.350
Did you have any friend in Sobibor?

39:37.380 --> 39:37.990

57:13.690 --> 57:19.980
He that way, he tried to went away, and we went the other way

57:19.980 --> 57:28.610

or not? In Pskov? When did you talk for the first time after the war about Sobibor?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.100
For the first time in Pskov

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:26.820
To whom? And whom did you talk to?

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:33.440
There was nobody to talk to, I did not have my parents any more. Neither father

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:39.140
nor mother, neither brothers nor sisters, everyone of my people died

01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:49.250
About the camp, about the camp, what did you[?] You have

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:59.180
been in the camp, when did you talk for the first time?

01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:05.960
Just a second, just a second

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:11.210
But I, but I did not confess, that I was in the camp

01:46:11.210 --> 01:46:11.650
Nobody knew?

01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:12.440
And when did you say for the first time about it?

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:12.440
When?

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:12.440
I just confessed, when I married in Leningrad

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:12.920
You married in Pskov

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.840
I, I married in the Leningrad region, then came to Pskov

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:13.840
Registered your marriage

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:13.840
brought my wife here from Pskov

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:22.770
First he said, he didn’t talk with anyone about it and now he says, he might have talked about it

01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:23.960
And when did you talk about the camp?

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.730
I never mentioned the camp

01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:25.730
To nobody?

01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:27.070
No [=yes, to nobody]

01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.710
Never?

01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:27.890
Never

01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:29.420
And to the wife?

01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:31.090
Not to the wife as well

01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:36.420
Never talked about it. Not to his wife, not to anyone

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.370
You were not allowed to talk to anybody ? without parents, without everyone

01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:50.430
You were not allowed to talk to anybody?

01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.290
To whom

01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:57.325
It was not ok to talk about it, there was no one to talk to,

01:46:57.325 --> 01:47:03.160
his family had died, he really couldn’t’ talk about it

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:09.176
She was god, she accompanied me to Kegesep, she accompanied me to the military unit, my wife;

01:47:09.176 --> 01:47:14.740
and then she died, my wife. And I confessed to nobody, that Ilived, that I, that I was

01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:20.000
Was in the camp

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:29.953
that I left the service, that I lived with someone – to nobody. And later I got

01:47:29.953 --> 01:47:38.590
well-founded, they gave me an apartment, I already had my own nest. I came

01:47:38.590 --> 01:47:52.340
In the year of 47 he married, took a girl from the Pskov region, the village of Nea

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.050
1947 he got married and he in the Pskov province

01:47:56.050 --> 01:47:56.050
Yeah

01:47:56.050 --> 01:48:05.360
His wife. His wife, her family was poor

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.850
It was a poor family

01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:06.850
Neither father

01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:11.061
There was nothing to put on; my wife had nothing to put on: neither

01:48:11.061 --> 01:48:14.770
shoes nor boots. Nothing. To bring her to the military unit

01:48:14.770 --> 01:48:15.330
There was nothing

01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:16.020
There was nothing

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:16.020
She had nothing

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:23.010
Well, poor, poor, it was a poor family

01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:28.850
SpT She was very poor and she didn’t have boots, she didn’t have anything

01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:31.606
Everything that she had was I called in at a flea market, there

01:48:31.606 --> 01:48:34.320
I bought everything. Apart from that she did not have anything

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:34.320
Was she also Jewish?

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.030
Was she, was she Jewish, your wife?

01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:50.750
Who? No, she was Russian

01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:52.560
No? No, Russian

01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:55.700
was Russian

01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:59.820
And he doesn’t know Do you know, when you, when it can be possible to talk about Sobibor?

01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.367
When, if you know it, when was it possible to talk about Sobibor, to talk

01:49:02.367 --> 01:49:04.670
about the camp? When did you begin to talk about it? To strangers?

01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:04.670
I, I talked about the camp already in Pskov

01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:04.670
Already in Pskov?

01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:16.999
Yes. It was, we had already gone through this, through

01:49:16.999 --> 01:49:29.100
one camp, the second one, the third one, then we went

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:30.340
Grandfather, collect your thoughts

01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:30.480
Eh?

01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:36.260
Just about the camp

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:38.820
He says, in Pskov he talked about it

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:42.380
When did you start to tell: that I was in the camp

01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:48.850
In the camp? In Pskov, when we moved to Pskov, I began to speak

01:49:48.850 --> 01:49:52.450
To whom did you tell this?

01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:53.030
Eh? To friends

01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:54.610
To friends?

01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:55.250
Yes

01:49:56.190 --> 01:49:56.500
There, where you served

01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.770
In Pskov

01:49:58.770 --> 01:50:04.820
He says, he told his friends in Pskov when he came, that he had been in the camp

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:09.270
You confessed, that you had been in the camp in Sobibor

01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.270
In the camp, yes

01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:11.270
He said, that he’d been in the camp

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:17.562
Then I made up my mind that I stay to serve in the Soviet

01:50:17.562 --> 01:50:21.160
Army and I had been serving in the army for 22 years

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.610
He served 22 years in the Soviet army

01:50:23.610 --> 01:50:23.750
And later, after that, when did you begin to talk; whom else did you tell?

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:24.390
It was

01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:30.300
In the 50-s, 60-s, 80-s

01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:35.160
I told nobody

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:37.780
Nobody

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:37.950
Nobody

01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:45.560
He did not talk to anyone about it, so we have to [unclear]

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:51.540
[unclear] Eh, he must have been very alone

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:51.540
Was it hard not to talk about it?

01:50:51.890 --> 01:51:01.337
Well, you were not allowed to talk about it to that time. Later we started to jump. Parachute jumps.

01:51:01.337 --> 01:51:11.068
When I had talked about it, then the OBHS, he means the NKVD would have taken me on its list (account?)

01:51:11.068 --> 01:51:19.760
and – that’s over, they would have done away with me. They began to control at that time

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:19.760
The KGB

01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:30.259
That’s why he could not talk about it. No, it would have been very dangerous

01:51:30.259 --> 01:51:38.950
in terms that the KGB to talk about it, so it just wasn’t a choice

01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:39.960
I want to take it

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:47.420
Just a moment, just a moment, we’ll talk first and then we’ll take it

01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:48.700
I’m getting up

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:53.760
Yes, he tells, I think, he wants to show you something, but ask you, ask you

01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:57.540
We’ll do pictures later

01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:02.360
Later, she wants to look the photos later

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.330
Sit down, sit down

01:52:03.330 --> 01:52:05.278
The KGB, I understand, it was forbidden to talk about

01:52:05.278 --> 01:52:07.080
Sobibor, but when did it change with perestrojka?

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:11.763
So, we understand, that it was such a forbidden topic, well, a dangerous

01:52:11.763 --> 01:52:16.316
subject. Did everything change during the period of Gorbačëv, during

01:52:16.316 --> 01:52:20.610
the perestrojka? Did you begin to talk about it then, in the 80-s?

01:52:20.610 --> 01:52:36.357
I began to talk in Kegesep, where I called in with a closed division team to play football. In

01:52:36.357 --> 01:52:51.770
Kegesep, it is in the East Prussia, well, they stayed there to protect it and I stayed there

01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:54.660
About Sobibor, well, when did you begin to speak openly about Sobibor?

01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.950
About Sobibor? Well, I spoke openly already, already in

01:52:58.170 --> 01:53:04.530
well, without frightening of anything, so

01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:11.230
In Kegesep

01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:16.170
No, he is just mixing things up [sighing]

01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:18.540
Actually he did not talk to anyone, as the saying goes

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:19.430
To nobody

01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:23.290
I understand. Of course he's saying, he just never talked about it

01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:24.250
It was a closed theme

01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:28.960
That theme was a closed theme, we understand that. We try to understand when he talked about this

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:38.155
And why weren’t you allowed to talk? Because you did not know, what awaited you: whether

01:53:38.155 --> 01:53:46.330
you’ll stay in the air-landing forces or you’ll be sent to this another unit

01:53:46.330 --> 01:53:49.180
You did not know what awaited you if you talk about it

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:59.567
There was nothing of that. Even when I married, I didn’t

01:53:59.567 --> 01:54:07.540
tell anything to Ninočka, even when I was married

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:08.330
Did not talk to his wife, did not tell his grandchildren

01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:10.250
Did you tell Polina Agafonovna, that you were prisoner of the camp?

01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.530
No

01:54:10.530 --> 01:54:11.260
Did not tell his wife

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:14.780
She did not know till, till her death

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:26.290
Did not know Well, he began in the 90-s, so

01:54:26.290 --> 01:54:28.440
I see. He’s telling us that it was in the 90-s

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.590
Even the end of the 90-s

01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:30.540
that he talked about it

01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:30.540
At the end

01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:35.340
At the end of the 90-s? At the end? The end of the 90-s, which is quite remarkable

01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:46.040
He, he began to speak, but he talked so vague, so ambiguous, he didn’t tell any details

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:49.938
He started delicately talk about it, no details, of it, in the end

01:54:49.938 --> 01:54:53.660
of the 90-s, which is about 10-15 years after perestrojka began

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.030
You could not tell anything, because you don’t know what is awaiting you the next day

01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:04.440
You didn’t want to say anything, because you didn’t know what happen tomorrow

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.790
Now bring this, it will be interesting for her

01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:19.670
Soon, you’ll just give the interview and then we’ll look it

01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:20.410
Well, let us

01:55:20.410 --> 01:55:21.660
We’ll do it later

01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:29.550
Ok, I think, later is not a long time from now, but go ahead

01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:35.337
I know. We are now breaking the silence about Sobibor and there is a

01:55:35.337 --> 01:55:41.040
huge trial of Dem’janjuk. Is it very Why is it important for you?

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:49.200
Now it is spoken more about Sobibor, there is no more such a silence about that what happened

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:57.940
Nobody knew, I did not tell it to anybody

01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:02.820
I understand. I did not talk to anyone about it. Now there is a trial. Why

01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:03.451
Now, now I served in the regiment, I’m jumping now in the regiment

01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:03.980
and I confess, that I served. It was allowed to tell this

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:09.889
He serves Yes, he couldn’t talk about it. The trial about Dem’janjuk is now taking place.

01:56:09.889 --> 01:56:15.290
Why is this trial so important for you? We understand, that it is important, but why?

01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:16.520
Dem’janjuk is now being sued, you know about it

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:16.520
I know

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.020
Is this trial important for you?

01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:23.627
I, I, I, when I would meet him now, I would confess him, that I’m this Waitsen

01:56:23.627 --> 01:56:29.024
Alexej, which served together with him, we served together; and then he left,

01:56:29.024 --> 01:56:33.370
how long was he not here – for 2 years hasn’t he been here

01:56:33.370 --> 01:56:39.490
You are asked about Dem’janjuk

01:56:39.490 --> 01:56:47.660
I tell about Dem’janjuk as well

01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:51.310
Which was warder

01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:58.460
The warder, yeah. I would, I wouldn’t to be going to

01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:15.666
When you were there, in the trial, would you tell anything

01:57:15.666 --> 01:57:31.390
to him or to the court? About Dem’janjuk? Would you

01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:35.760
I did not talk about him, no

01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.830
What would you like to tell?

01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:42.378
What I wanted to tell, then, and then I changed my mind, I thought that it makes

01:57:42.378 --> 01:57:46.643
no sense to tell this. What if he got to know more, reconnaissance, the KGB

01:57:46.643 --> 01:57:50.510
and they would take him and arrest him, and I couldn’t do anything

01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:51.700
Arrest you?

01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:58.770
Eh?

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:04.304
I said, what you would like to say if the trial – nothing and suddenly

01:58:04.304 --> 01:58:08.250
the KGB could come and there could be consequences for me

01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:14.450
But what would he say now in Frankfurt? In München, sorry

01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:16.859
When you would have a possibility to be in München, there, where the

01:58:16.859 --> 01:58:19.060
trial is taking place, what would you tell him or to the judge?

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:27.340
There were so many thoughts and there was nothing else

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:27.340
No, Dem’janjuk is now being sued

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:27.340
Yes

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:32.070
What could you tell at the trial?

01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:42.179
What could I say? Well, I could say that there was someone – Dem’janjuk, that he was

01:58:42.179 --> 01:58:52.634
in the SS-division, served there. I could tell everything, but I did not. I did not enlarge

01:58:52.634 --> 01:59:02.170
on the apropos of this division. I served myself in the ?]30th division in the army

01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:11.680
He would say, that he served in the SS-

01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:15.460
In the Nazi-division

01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:18.740
Yeah, he would say, that he had served in the Nazi-division

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:19.750
Mh

01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:22.340
That Dem’janjuk served in the Nazi-division, the SS-division

01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:28.975
And would he say more, he would stand in court, Dem’janjuk would be

01:59:28.975 --> 01:59:35.130
there. Is there any words he wants to say to the world about it?

01:59:35.130 --> 01:59:35.642
When you stayed there – you an Dem’janjuk – what would you

01:59:35.642 --> 01:59:36.090
like to tell to the world about him? About Dem’janjuk?

01:59:36.090 --> 01:59:59.060
I did not think over, never. I served both in Pskov and in Kingissepp, I served in many places

01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:00.170
No

02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:00.170
I did not tell anyone about Sobibor

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:04.380
He did not talk about Sobibor

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:06.080
What could you tell at the present moment about Dem’janjuk

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:06.080
What could I tell?

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:06.320
Yes

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.580
That there was such a bandit, I could tell everything, but I did not

02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:08.280
He’s bandit, that’s he would say

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:09.460
But I did not tell

02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.420
We understand

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:31.100
And, well, that he is a bandit and he is just fit for shooting

02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.570
He is a bandit and he, he actually should be shot

02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:40.990
You said, you recognized him

02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:45.790
You recognized him, you recognized his face

02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:51.022
I recognized, I recognized; he stayed in the division, then he came to serve

02:00:51.022 --> 02:00:55.980
in the division, in the 630th? army; I knew his autobiography, I knew it

02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:57.090
He knew his autobiography

02:00:57.090 --> 02:01:01.770
[in a whisper, unclear]

02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:04.690
He says, he wants to show you something

02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:06.500
You should turn it off

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.840
Can you turn it off for a second?

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.520
Yeah, but I’m

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:08.690
[pause]

02:01:08.690 --> 02:01:19.610
It was so: where you served, how long you served, how many jumps you made and how many

02:01:19.610 --> 02:01:20.770
It was a forbidden subject

02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:21.170
Forbidden, yes

02:01:21.170 --> 02:01:36.994
It was a forbidden theme to talk about this. I wanna ask him And

02:01:36.994 --> 02:01:50.840
this theme was not forbidden any more, eh, just a second

02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:50.970
Eh?

02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:52.260
Under Gorbačëv, do you remember Gorbačëv, yes, Michail Sergejevič?

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:52.260
Yes, yes

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:52.487
When he came to power, people did talk about it. Did you personally

02:01:52.487 --> 02:01:52.640
talk under Gorbačëv, under the glasnost’?

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.600
We understood, remembered, but did not talk, no

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:56.590
Even then?

02:01:56.590 --> 02:01:56.950
Even then

02:01:56.950 --> 02:02:03.710
Didn't even talk about it then, under glasnost‘. Only at the end of the 90-ty years?

02:02:03.710 --> 02:02:03.820
Yes

02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:05.660
Only in the end of the 90-s

02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:16.550
Then, then he, well, at the beginning of the 90-s we, so to speak, tortured him: tell us Because I,

02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:26.780
the parents told me at certain time, that your grandfather had been in the concentration camp

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:31.334
Just a second, I’m translating Ok, please He started talking about it only

02:02:31.334 --> 02:02:35.889
in the 90-s, because they – the children, the grandchildren – pushed him

02:02:35.889 --> 02:02:40.504
to talk about it, because they heard from their parents, that grandfather had

02:02:40.504 --> 02:02:44.640
been in the camps. I’m going ask him, how he heard from the parents

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:45.590
How heard the parents

02:02:45.590 --> 02:02:58.400
Yes. Your parents, how did they get to know about it? They told you? How did parents get to know?

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:11.500
Parents did not know as well

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:16.730
No. Parents told, told me, but

02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:16.730
How did they know?

02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:17.240
ordered me to keep silence. They? Well, [sighing] I don’t

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:17.630
know, how father got to know, how father knew

02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:17.630
[unclear]

02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:22.719
O, can you come closer to the tape-recorder? He doesn’t know, how his parents

02:03:22.719 --> 02:03:27.874
knew, but he does know, they swore him to silence about it, to talking about it,

02:03:27.874 --> 02:03:32.964
but they did tell him. And he’s trying to remember, how it was possible, that

02:03:32.964 --> 02:03:37.409
his parents would know. You did not talk about it with your children?

02:03:37.410 --> 02:03:39.290
About Sobibor? You did not talk about it?

02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.430
To the children?

02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.810
To your children?

02:03:39.810 --> 02:03:41.560
To the children – no

02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:44.400
No, he did not talk to his children about it

02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:50.039
The children did not know, nobody knew. It was not allowed

02:03:50.039 --> 02:03:53.960
to talk about it, otherwise they would be sent to Siberia

02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:58.999
You were afraid. They were afraid to be sent to Siberia if they talked about it. Can

02:03:58.999 --> 02:04:03.770
I, may I ask yes? Eh, do you remember when these talks began in the 90-ty years?

02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:07.120
Openly, yes, at the end of the 90-s

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:08.470
But somehow, your parents knew somehow

02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:17.906
I was just a little boy, just a little boy, they told me,

02:04:17.906 --> 02:04:26.350
that your grandfather was in the concentration camp

02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:30.560
SpT I was a young boy and they said, your father was in a concentration camp

02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:37.780
They told that they escaped. Naturally I had a question: how did they escape?

02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:40.960
He said, he escaped and he said

02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.905
Well, they said, they made an undermining and escaped, seven

02:04:44.905 --> 02:04:48.260
persons, it was not given away, that the whole camp

02:04:48.260 --> 02:22:37.400
