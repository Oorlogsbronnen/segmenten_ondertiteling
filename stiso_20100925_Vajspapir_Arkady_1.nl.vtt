So, your family, did they meet Jews, or did you just live with non-Jews?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.620
mother died in 1920.

03:58.620 --> 04:07.960
That's not the question. You tell that you lived in a Jewish colony, a totally Jewish one.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.340
I said, Jewish people, Jewish people, in a Jewish region, that's how it was.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.000

? Not our colony, but a region it was.SpNN A whole Jewish region.

04:14.270 --> 04:20.570
The whole region was Jewish.

04:20.570 --> 04:20.990
Er, sorry, I

04:20.990 --> 04:24.370
But these were not such Jews like, er, not from those religious Jews, like, er, Western.

04:24.370 --> 04:28.170
Those were not very religious Jews, not like in the Western Ukraine.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.920
OK, about your family, we were talking about

04:30.920 --> 04:32.880
M-m, yes, excuse me, we interrupted you, you were telling about your family.

04:32.880 --> 04:57.890
Yes, I say, this grandpa had contacted with another wife, (she/they) had two daughters

04:57.890 --> 05:02.950
Er, my grandfather and his second wife had two sisters

05:02.950 --> 05:04.837

05:04.837 --> 05:06.360
one year older than my aunts, than these here.

05:06.360 --> 05:13.440
[grins] And it turned out that my brother and I were a year older than our, er, a(u)nts.

Yes, well, now, and we lived together, all just from this large family, I alone stayed alive.

05:22.980 --> 05:28.290
And we lived all together but of this large family I'm the only one who survived.

05:28.290 --> 05:29.850
After the war I was alone.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.670
After the war I remained the only one.

05:31.670 --> 05:37.390
Because you were in the army.

05:37.390 --> 05:40.590
Because you were at the front, yes, at that time.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.150
Because I was at the front, then, in this hospital, I was wounded

05:44.150 --> 05:45.030
First of all he was

05:45.030 --> 05:45.630
and this, and

05:45.630 --> 05:46.320
at the front, and he was in the hospital

05:46.320 --> 05:46.320
our sanbat

05:46.320 --> 05:46.910
because I was

05:46.910 --> 05:46.910
got to Kiev, in Kiev, well, in this Kiev]

05:46.910 --> 05:46.910
M-m.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.410
Er, (we) got encircled, and I was in a hospital for prisoners of war.

05:49.410 --> 05:49.410
M-m, аnd then

05:49.410 --> 05:51.060
Then I was discovered as a Jew.

05:51.060 --> 05:51.090
M-m.

05:56.030 --> 06:03.370
And I was in the concentration camp, in Minsk.

06:03.370 --> 06:04.020
And so

06:04.020 --> 06:05.230
And then

06:05.230 --> 06:05.230
You can remember, yeah?

06:05.230 --> 06:07.150
in the concentration camp in Minsk, in Minsk I was

06:08.300 --> 06:09.200
I know, there

06:09.200 --> 06:25.020
in the concentration camp, yes, and it was named, at the Broad street it was, yes, there, in [?]

06:25.020 --> 06:25.350
M-m.

06:27.840 --> 06:34.830
Well, this was a concentration camp for Jewish prisoners of war.

06:34.830 --> 06:35.370
M-m.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.680
Moment. Ja?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.510
Er, so then his hospital was

06:42.080 --> 06:42.400
You don't

06:42.400 --> 06:55.117
taken by the Germans and he was in the hospital for pulse, then it was found out he's Jewish

06:55.117 --> 07:06.730
and he was sent to Minsk, there was a ghetto on the Shiroka Street, the Wide Street.

07:06.730 --> 07:06.730
Goh.

07:06.730 --> 07:10.280
But in in '43, in August, I thinkSpT And I think in August '41

07:10.280 --> 07:12.860
our concentration camp, and the Minsk ghetto, was deported to Sobibor, and

07:13.420 --> 07:13.970
I understood.

07:13.970 --> 07:27.448
and all were annihilated. Only eighty people were left, former prisoners

07:27.448 --> 07:37.370
of war, er, to build the Nordlager, as it was called.

07:37.370 --> 07:38.470
Moment, m-mm.

07:38.470 --> 07:45.522
Only eighty people out of that transport to Sobibor were saved,

07:45.522 --> 07:51.120
because they had to build the so-called Nordlager.

07:51.430 --> 08:01.345
We built barracks, and they sort of said, that this will be a camp

08:01.345 --> 08:10.360
for, er, repairing and sorting out of trophy weaponry, well.

08:10.360 --> 08:10.970
And, er

08:14.190 --> 08:20.630
Er, then we organized the uprising and escaped.

08:20.730 --> 08:29.097
They first said us we would be building a camp and barracks to store the trophy weapons,

08:29.097 --> 08:36.990
and after that he had an uprising and everyone ran escaped to different directions.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.030
You said you were one year in Sobibor?

08:41.030 --> 08:42.550
A, a month, one month.

08:44.680 --> 08:45.230
One month, so.

08:45.230 --> 08:56.460
You said, you were for about a month in Sobibor, yes?

08:56.460 --> 08:58.257
Yes, for a month in all, we were brought there and they

08:58.257 --> 08:59.990
all were destroyed, but eighty people were left well.

08:59.990 --> 09:03.240
They brought everyone was killed and only eighty people remained.

09:03.290 --> 09:06.990
You don't have to translate every time, it will be translated, okay?

09:07.310 --> 09:07.610
Okay.

09:07.610 --> 09:17.090
Okay, go on. You said you had different communities inside the camp.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.983
But you were telling that in the camp itself there were several,

09:19.983 --> 09:22.470
well, like communities, yes, friends in different ways.

09:22.470 --> 09:31.089
Yes. Now, er, we with the prisoners of war, we totally

09:31.089 --> 09:39.070
clang together all in a heap, in sum, all together

09:39.070 --> 09:48.028
we worked in the Normlager but others were tailors, there (were) cobblers,

09:48.028 --> 09:56.745
all kinds of, well, I don't know, what these Dutch were doing, In short,

09:56.745 --> 10:04.130
er, I had very little contact with all these Poles and Dutch.

10:04.130 --> 10:04.130
M-mm.

10:04.130 --> 10:07.540
Well, now, Poles there were most of all, Polish Jews well.

10:07.540 --> 10:15.237
Er, so he's explaining that he had very little contact to either Dutch or Polish

10:15.237 --> 10:23.416
Jews, er, and that the prisoners of war stick together as one group, but the majority

10:23.416 --> 10:31.114
he says were Polish er Jews, and he doesn't know what the Dutch Jews were doing,

10:31.114 --> 10:37.080
but some were working as shoesters or some were doing clothes.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.090
Thank you. He was together with Pechersky?

10:39.090 --> 10:40.700
You were together with Pechersky?

10:40.700 --> 10:52.433
Yes, well, Pechersky was for us like a leader, well, he was older than we, about

10:52.433 --> 11:04.020
ten years, fifteen, I don't know, twelve years he was older than me, right, er,

11:04.020 --> 11:15.606
well, and, in short, somehow, well, there was something by which we trusted him

11:15.606 --> 11:25.580
more, we all respected him, well, and he was like a leader among us.

11:25.580 --> 11:29.045
He was there a leader, he was older than, he was twelve or fifteen years older,

11:29.045 --> 11:31.940
and he was very trustworthy, that's why they took him as a leader.

11:31.940 --> 11:35.060
I was, in short, very close to him.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.710
He was very close to him.

11:37.710 --> 11:38.460
Well, in short, yes.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.930
Stop. Did you meet him in Minsk or before all this?

11:40.930 --> 11:44.380
But you met him first in Minsk or did you know him already before?

11:44.380 --> 11:56.069
Er, in Minsk, already in Minsk. But it's true he worked in another commando, er, there was

11:56.069 --> 12:07.629
a commando, the hospital it was called, well in the hospital, there they executed certain

12:07.629 --> 12:18.020
works, but I worked as a docker in the Truppenwirtschaftlager, as it was called.

12:18.020 --> 12:22.706
In Minsk he was doing different kinds of work, er, they were

12:22.706 --> 12:27.080
doing something in the hospital and I was loading stuff.

12:27.890 --> 12:35.220
Can he talk a little bit about Minsk, can he tell a little bit about the conditions in Minsk?

12:39.380 --> 12:46.000
Can you tell a bit more about Minsk and about what kind of conditions there were in Minsk?

12:46.000 --> 12:50.860
And how they were deported.

12:50.860 --> 12:54.410
And how you were then deported from there, from Minsk.

12:54.410 --> 13:01.937
[coughs] Well, in Minsk, well, what kind of conditions, conditions

13:01.937 --> 13:09.350
were bad. They gave (each) a ration of bread and one time skilly.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.420
He had little food, a piece of bread, some kind of porridge.

13:11.420 --> 13:11.600
Well.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.700
Conditions were bad.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.982
But those who worked, well, those who were in the camp, who were weak and could

13:15.982 --> 13:19.182
not get to work, died, of course. But at, work, if I worked as a docker, well

13:19.182 --> 13:21.800
if we were loading potatoes or so, er, we would steal something

13:21.800 --> 13:22.620
M, mmm.

13:22.620 --> 13:30.000
Er, what was being brought in. We had gasmasks

13:30.000 --> 13:30.320
M-m.

13:30.320 --> 13:30.320
[?]

13:33.540 --> 14:00.046
Each had gasmasks in a bag, and there (we would put what we stole) and bring it with us into the

14:00.046 --> 14:26.000
camp sniffs, we brought (it) with us and there we lived in the camp, we live(d) like a family.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.720
M-m.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.400
We were with four people,

14:30.400 --> 14:38.330
me, I say, from Kherson province, and them, all three were Odessites.

14:38.330 --> 14:38.790
M-mm.

14:40.150 --> 14:41.120
Moment.

14:41.510 --> 14:47.959
So, the weaker ones of course died because there was not enough to eat, but those who could

14:47.959 --> 14:54.196
work, for example I was loading sometimes potatoes, sometimes something else, and we all

14:54.196 --> 15:00.362
had special bags for gas masks, so we would steal something, put it in these gas masks,

15:00.362 --> 15:06.528
and then bring back to the lager, to the camp, and there were four of us, who were like

15:06.528 --> 15:11.490
a family, there was me from Kherson, and three other guys from Odessa.

15:12.100 --> 15:18.130
Yashka was one lame Odessite, he worked as a cleaner

15:18.130 --> 15:18.350
M-mm.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.740
in the camp.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.770
M-mm. One of them was [?]

15:23.100 --> 15:28.660
But we, the other three, worked in various jobs well.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.920
The other three had different jobs.

15:31.920 --> 15:36.470
And well, we brought (things) and at our coming cooked potatoes or something, in short, yes, already

15:36.470 --> 15:38.360
We were bringing some food [?]

15:38.460 --> 15:49.518
so that during the last period we didn't have hunger, well,

15:49.518 --> 16:00.390
right, so, we survived. But when they brought us into this

16:00.390 --> 16:08.470
Moment. If you talk when he is talking

16:08.470 --> 16:08.470
[?]

16:08.470 --> 16:10.180
it is very difficult, yeah?

16:10.180 --> 16:11.270
Okay, I understand.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.690
We do not delay the process. Okay, what did he say?

16:14.130 --> 16:21.001
He said that, that when Yasha was working as a cleaner, he would often prepare food for them,

16:21.001 --> 16:27.800
from the things they've stolen when unloading stuff, and that's how they managed to survive.

16:27.800 --> 16:42.571
When they lined us all up, and said, Are there tailors, cobblers? Step out! Then: Who can carry

16:42.571 --> 16:56.721
a bag of hundred eighty kilogram, step out as well. I stepped out, and then this, er, Fimka

16:56.721 --> 17:11.648
also was dragged out and we got (there), well, but the others were seized, the others and Yashka

17:11.648 --> 17:23.310
and this, er, they, er, were sent into the chambers, into the gas chambers.

17:23.310 --> 17:28.070
Later, when we were brought, we were lined up, and people would be calling.

17:28.070 --> 17:28.930
Would be

17:28.930 --> 17:35.400
Just That, that thing, okay, put that, yeah? Sure.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.250
Er, so

17:36.250 --> 17:51.460
No you have to I'll show you, I'll show you.

17:51.460 --> 18:05.180
No I just

18:05.180 --> 18:07.660
No no no no. No no no no.

18:07.660 --> 18:08.470
Okay, now.

18:08.470 --> 18:11.100
Okay, you manage? And then, and then you.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.250
This inside, and this one outside.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.430
Ja. Er. Yeah?

18:14.430 --> 18:15.520
Like this.

18:15.520 --> 18:15.520
[?]

18:15.520 --> 18:21.751
So, he was saying that they were lined up and they would ask, who is a shoemaker, who

18:21.751 --> 18:28.203
is a tailor, and then they were asked, who can lift a bag eighty kilograms weight, until

18:28.203 --> 18:34.361
he stood out and he took one of his former comrades, Fimka, out, and that's how they

18:34.361 --> 18:39.860
stayed alive, and the rest of his comrades were killed in gas chamber then.

18:39.860 --> 18:43.170
In Sobibor.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.380
In Sobibor this happened, yes?

18:44.380 --> 18:44.530
What?

18:44.530 --> 18:46.440
In Sobibor this happened already, when you stepped out and drew out Fimka after you.

18:54.670 --> 19:01.990
What, how, well, we sort of stepped out.

19:01.990 --> 19:07.620
This was already in Sobibor? Yes?

19:07.620 --> 19:08.510
What, what was?

19:08.510 --> 19:15.610
Well, when they were calling you out, as a cobbler, as who can lift eighty kilogram.

19:15.610 --> 19:20.017
When the train arrived, and (we) were lined op along the railroad cars, and they were

19:20.017 --> 19:24.581
asking, er, Step out, they said, Are there tailors, cobblers? Yes. Step out. Then, well,

19:24.581 --> 19:28.730
they took out these dockers, then they said, in short, Weak ones, also step out.

19:28.730 --> 19:37.895
And the others, we were taken apart to one side, but the others to different, into these,

19:37.895 --> 19:46.854
er, gas chambers. We didn't even know at all, by then we didn't know yet, but then (we)

19:46.854 --> 19:56.226
asked the older camp inmates, Where are all the others of us (They answered), (Over there),

19:56.226 --> 20:02.920
you see that smoke there, well this already is your comrades all.

20:02.920 --> 20:09.082
It happened in[ Sobibor, when the trains came, they would be lining us up and calling others,

20:09.082 --> 20:14.847
and then we were taken to one side, they were taken to the other side. At that point we

20:14.847 --> 20:20.546
did not know anything, of course, and afterwards we asked the old inmates of the camp,

20:20.546 --> 20:25.450
Where is the rest, and they showed us the smoke and said, That's the rest.

20:28.380 --> 20:33.055
Can he tell me how he landed from Minsk in Sobibor? And there's

20:33.055 --> 20:36.840
a moment in which he learned he had to leave Minsk.

20:36.840 --> 20:42.280
Er, at the moment when he learned, he has to leave Minsk. M-m.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.300
To leave Minsk, how, and when.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.651
But do you remember how it happened, well, when you found out that you were going

20:46.651 --> 20:50.126
to be transferred from Minsk, do you remember that moment? How did this happen? When

20:50.126 --> 20:53.230
did they tell you, that, well, you were going to be transferred from Minsk?

20:53.230 --> 21:00.902
[coughs] (We) were brought from the ghetto into our camp, and then loaded into railroad

21:00.902 --> 21:09.016
cars. We were told that we were brought to Germany for work. And they loaded us, well, those

21:09.016 --> 21:16.689
whom they had brought from the ghetto. The first train was ours, they drove it off, and

21:16.689 --> 21:23.480
then another two trains after our one arrived as well, from the Minsk ghetto.

21:28.290 --> 21:28.660
So

21:28.660 --> 21:33.960
We were told, You're going to Germany to work (there).

21:33.960 --> 21:45.223
So they were said they would be taken to Germany for work, and people from the ghettoes were deported

21:45.223 --> 21:56.932
for the moment, and also from their camp. Er, and they were deported together. He says they were deported

21:56.932 --> 22:07.080
in the first train and then afterwards there were two more trains with the ghetto dwellers.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.300
And they were all killed.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.810
Er, and they all perished? All these trains? All, who arrived?

22:13.810 --> 22:17.620
Of course, all!

22:17.620 --> 22:20.280
Yes, of course.

22:20.280 --> 22:25.040
Well, these eighty people were left. Three trains from Minsk, all perished.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.580
Three trains from Minsk and only eighty people were left.

22:30.210 --> 22:35.994
Er, did he leave, live in a large barracks in Sobibor,

22:35.994 --> 22:41.030
what were his conditions? Where was he staying?

22:41.030 --> 22:48.978
M-m. But in Sobibor, when you were there, did you stay in some large sort barracks,

22:48.978 --> 22:55.970
do you remember which were the conditions at that place, where you lived?

22:55.970 --> 23:07.791
Well, I remember, er, bunks, and this bunk of two levels, lower and upper levels, and (made)

23:07.791 --> 23:18.200
of planks, well, and, how we made our beds with what one had, and so, and so, er.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.360
I remember these benches, of course.

23:20.360 --> 23:28.041
This is considered, of course, very bad, if this is so, but we were

23:28.041 --> 23:35.380
used (to) that, er, (nothing) better, sort of all right [grins].

23:35.380 --> 23:39.539
Er, of course it looks very, very bad, but we were used

23:39.539 --> 23:43.320
to it and that's why we found it was the usual way

23:43.320 --> 23:43.320
M-m. He was healthy all the time, in Sobibor?

23:45.020 --> 23:49.020
Er, you were not ill during the time you were there?

23:49.020 --> 23:49.310
I, where?

23:49.310 --> 23:49.640
In Sobibor]

23:49.640 --> 23:59.248
In Sobibor? Sort of no. Whoever was ill, those were taken away, taken away, ill people

23:59.248 --> 24:08.746
were not kept, they were taken away, and it was visible, to, er, the third camp as it

24:08.746 --> 24:18.354
was called. The third camp, that was the camp, er, of destruction. And there they were

24:18.354 --> 24:27.070
taken, into the third camp, from where there were no, (there) was no way back.

24:27.750 --> 24:34.309
Obviously I did not, because those who were ill were taken away to the so-called third camp, and, and

24:34.309 --> 24:40.610
no one came back, back from there. There were no ill people. If you got ill, you were taken away.

24:41.450 --> 24:57.850
So can he tell me how he heard for the first time about the ideas of the

24:57.850 --> 25:13.340
uprising? And if he wants to speak longer, I know a lot of the story

25:13.340 --> 25:13.710
M-m.

25:13.710 --> 25:14.150
so just give me short details please, okay?

25:14.150 --> 25:21.758
Okay. Er, do you remember when for the first time you heard that there was to be some

25:21.758 --> 25:28.740
kind of uprising? Well, when did you hear for the first time about such ideas?

25:28.740 --> 25:31.794
How we heard? Well, it was us who organized this uprising. I was, I was

25:31.794 --> 25:34.977
in, er, the uprising committee, I, er, together with this Sasha, together,

25:34.977 --> 25:37.730
er, we slept together, together we knew, we prepared everything.

25:37.730 --> 25:40.986
I was into the committee, so together with Sasha we even

25:40.986 --> 25:44.010
slept together, and we prepared everything together.

25:45.510 --> 25:54.380
Er, how did this committee come to exist?

25:54.380 --> 26:00.000
M-m. Er, but how did this committee come up, for organizing the uprising?

26:00.000 --> 26:12.000
[coughs] In short, the committee was organized, er, the organizer was Sasha

26:12.000 --> 26:22.240
Pechersky, there was Shloymo, Shloymo, er, what was his surname?

26:22.240 --> 26:23.470
Leon Leon]

26:23.470 --> 26:33.459
Shloymo, forgot, well, he was in our, from Minsk. But he was a Pole! From Poland

26:33.459 --> 26:43.449
they were deported to Minsk, er, these Po(l)es, but from the Minsk ghetto he got

26:43.449 --> 26:52.439
to our camp, this Shloymo What the heck, well, now I forgot the surname.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.160
You remember the surname.

26:54.160 --> 26:54.270
Leon.

26:54.270 --> 26:55.400
Well, so this

26:55.400 --> 26:55.400
Leon.

26:55.400 --> 26:55.400
What?

26:55.400 --> 26:55.510
Leon is the surname!

26:55.510 --> 26:55.510
What?

26:55.510 --> 26:59.670
Shlomo Leon it was, wasn't it?

26:59.670 --> 27:00.090
Leitman.

27:00.090 --> 27:00.730
Ho-how?

27:00.750 --> 27:11.560
Shlemo Leon, she's asking again for the surname? She remembers the surname, Leon.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.710
No, Leitman it was.

27:14.710 --> 27:15.130
Leitman.

27:15.130 --> 27:25.434
Leitman]! Er, this Shloymo Leitman, yes, yes, Shloymo Leitman. Well, there

27:25.434 --> 27:35.879
were brought (some) of the Polish guys, a couple of people, and I, and this

27:35.879 --> 27:45.070
Shubaev, Shubaev from our (people). We and, of course, Sasha, well

27:45.200 --> 27:49.930
So he speaks that, er, some of committee

27:50.160 --> 27:50.470
And Tsybulsky also was with us.

27:50.470 --> 27:54.680
in the committee were Polish who were first brought to Minsk and then got to Sobibor.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.720
So they met in Minsk.

27:56.080 --> 27:56.920
Er, yes.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.180
This structure was created in Minsk.

27:58.180 --> 28:01.505
Er, so it turns out that this structure and you all met each other

28:01.505 --> 28:04.580
(when) still in Minsk? Yes, all these people, whom you named.

28:04.580 --> 28:16.299
No, not all. Er, this Leitman, but (there) were of those elder ones, camp inmates from the Poles,

28:16.299 --> 28:27.777
whom I even was not acquainted with. Well, I knew my own people, (but) er, the Poles I didn’t

28:27.777 --> 28:38.410
know, I knew Leitman, I knew this Sasha Pechersky, I knew, but those, er, I didn't know.

28:38.410 --> 28:41.853
So he knew only two of them, with whom he was in Minsk

28:41.853 --> 28:45.170
and the other two, they were old inmates of Sobibor]

28:45.170 --> 28:46.010
Yes, they were Polish.

28:46.010 --> 28:49.780
and he did not know them before, he didn't know the Polish people before.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.510
So can you talk about the preparation for the uprising?

28:52.510 --> 28:56.774
M-m, can you tell a little bit about the preparation itself

28:56.774 --> 29:00.460
for the uprising? How did you talk with each other?

29:00.460 --> 29:02.140
He had to be very secret.

29:02.140 --> 29:53.440
This, of course, was a great secret, probably?

29:53.440 --> 30:00.669
Well, a great secret, well well, I say, the point is that

30:00.669 --> 30:06.630
we knew, ooh, what, I altogether lost my voice.

30:06.630 --> 30:17.440
We knew that, er, the guard was Ukrainians, in short, Polizei, but there were about twenty people,

30:17.440 --> 30:28.472
Germans, work leaders. These Germans were armed with automatic guns, in short, armed well. But, but,

30:28.472 --> 30:39.503
these Polizei, we knew that the Germans didn't trust them. They would go their positions, they would

30:39.503 --> 30:50.424
give them an amount of cartridges there, but then, when they were changed, they took the cartridges

30:50.424 --> 31:01.786
away from them. I say, thus we concluded that we had to kill the Germans. Then we just knew that around

31:01.786 --> 31:12.487
the camp there was a minefield, I say, (we) must, er, we knew that, er, along the fence, close to

31:12.487 --> 31:23.408
the fence there were these small German houses of theirs, where the Germans lived. So, we concluded

31:23.408 --> 31:34.439
that probably opposite these little houses they would hardly have laid mines. I say, we, er, decided

31:34.439 --> 31:45.250
like this: that we had to kill some more Germans, and all in a mass to (run) to this, er, passage,

31:45.250 --> 31:55.951
straight to the Ukrainians, and, er, to cut the fence opposite the little houses. Well. And so it

31:55.951 --> 32:02.570
turned out, that, er, some mines exploded, well, a few. Well

32:02.570 --> 32:02.570
Moment. Sorry.

32:02.570 --> 32:10.691
Er, so they learned that there were about twenty Germans and more Ukrainians, but the Germans were

32:10.691 --> 32:18.977
not trusting Ukrainians, they learned that they were giving them certain amount of bullets when they

32:18.977 --> 32:27.264
were sent out for watch and then they were taken these bullets away. That's why they decided to kill

32:27.264 --> 32:35.468
as many as possible Germans and then to attack, er, the rest, and also they learned that there were

32:35.468 --> 32:43.672
German houses very near to the barbwire and probably there was no mines, there were no mines there.

32:43.672 --> 32:51.793
And so afterwards when the Germans were killed they decided to storm those direction and when they

32:51.793 --> 32:57.759
did so, er, there were one or two mines which exploded but not too many.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.410
I keep, keep

32:58.410 --> 32:58.770
Oh, er, okay.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.790
That's what he said.

33:00.790 --> 33:01.480
Er, and, er.

33:01.480 --> 33:01.870
And so we killed eleven Germans.

33:01.870 --> 33:02.380
We killed eleven Germans.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.640
And I with my helpers killed two Germans.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.860
I killed two with my friends.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.630
Did you ever kill before?

33:12.100 --> 33:16.790
Did you ever have, before, at some time, to kill?

33:16.790 --> 33:28.066
Don't you think that it is so easy to kill, moreover to kill with an axe. Er, after the killing

33:28.066 --> 33:38.630
I went to, er, Sasha, and I say, that's it, here you are, two pistols, one I kept myself,

33:38.630 --> 33:49.669
one I gave to him, here you are, and I was shaking all over, er, how could that be, something

33:49.669 --> 33:57.860
horrible, er, well, after all I killed a man, that's a horror, that's

33:57.860 --> 34:03.750
It was very terrible, it was

34:03.750 --> 34:04.740
I don't want to talk about it.

34:04.740 --> 34:11.675
It was very terrible of course, er, it's not simple to kill, er, to kill with an axe, and afterwards

34:11.675 --> 34:18.056
when I, we had to kill two, when I came to Sasha, I said, here you have two guns, one I left

34:18.056 --> 34:24.645
to myself, one I gave him, and I was all shivering a-and it was terrible, because I had to kill

34:24.645 --> 34:29.570
a person, it was a human life and I don't want to be, to talk about it.

34:29.570 --> 34:36.986
And he says to me, he says, You know, Frenzel is still alive, the most important one,

34:36.986 --> 34:44.228
Frenzel is alive. I (say), You look at me, can I still do something, I said to him,

34:44.228 --> 34:50.510
you, Sasha, look at me, can I still do something? And he says, Sit down.

34:50.510 --> 34:56.580
And then he said me, You know that Frenzel is, is still alive, the main one, the main German.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.540
Ja, Frenzel.

34:57.540 --> 35:03.910
And, er, I said, Sasha, look at me, I cannot do anything more now, and he said, Okay, stay.

35:05.070 --> 35:08.220
So he run to the fence. Thank you for telling this.

35:08.220 --> 35:11.300
Er, thank you very much that you told about this.

35:11.300 --> 35:14.920
It must be difficult.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.760
Of course this is very difficult for you, thank you.

35:16.760 --> 35:16.760
What?

35:16.760 --> 35:19.090
Very difficult for you to tell, thank you very much that you told.

35:19.090 --> 35:35.640
Thank you, spasibo. He run to the gate, er, with the others.

35:35.640 --> 35:45.817
Er, during the uprising you and the others ran to the gate,

35:45.817 --> 35:55.650
well, to that passage, where the little houses were, yes?

35:55.650 --> 36:00.895
Yes. I, I passed through the wire, passed, well and then, I say, we went out, many

36:00.895 --> 36:06.140
went out, out of this camp, well, but, er, well, those who were the organizers, we

36:06.140 --> 36:11.130
had arms, we I say, I say we went for reconnaissance, for reconnaissance, when

36:11.130 --> 36:11.130
M-m.

36:11.130 --> 36:23.218
when Shubaev says, Shubaev says, Well, this is maybe not very moral, er, ?

36:23.218 --> 36:35.307
case, he said, I won't go back We went away, and, he says, I won't return,

36:35.307 --> 36:47.070
because we all will perish and, er, they will perish and we will perish.

36:47.070 --> 36:47.580
Moment.

36:47.580 --> 36:47.920
And he

36:51.560 --> 36:53.390
So I

36:53.390 --> 36:53.670
Moment, okay?

36:53.670 --> 37:00.188
So I went through the barbwire, and then we ran away, and the group which were the organizers

37:00.188 --> 37:06.355
of the uprising, who had weapons, we went to do some intelligence, to see what's around.

37:06.355 --> 37:12.453
And maybe it's not they're immoral but one of us, Shubaev, he said, I'm not coming back

37:12.453 --> 37:17.850
from this intelligence, er, I'm not coming back, I'm not returning, because I

37:21.590 --> 37:31.758
The point is, that we for the whole night had been running, like, farther away from the camp.

37:31.758 --> 37:41.599
And then dawn came, and we appeared to be near the camp. We had been circling around, near

37:41.599 --> 37:52.751
the camp and we appeared to be close to the camp. And I was saying so, I went then for reconnaissance,

37:52.751 --> 38:02.920
where to go, but then, I say, we went already not just through the woods, but along the road.

38:02.920 --> 38:12.870
I say, we (went) so along the road, then Sasha was saying, we must walk on, not immediately

38:12.870 --> 38:22.491
cross the Bug but walk, but we must walk to the North, because we must cross in Belarus,

38:22.491 --> 38:32.223
not in Ukraine. And we, I say, went for the North, well, there were seven of us, and then

38:32.223 --> 38:37.690
crossed the Bug and got straight to the partisans.

38:37.690 --> 38:45.075
Er, so, we were running for the whole night, trying to get as far possible from Sobibor, but

38:45.075 --> 38:52.220
at, er, the dusk it turned out, at the dawn it turned out that, er, we were near the camp

38:52.220 --> 38:54.210
The gate.

38:54.210 --> 39:00.474
near the camp again, we were walking in circles, for the whole night, and afterwards Sasha said that

39:00.474 --> 39:06.988
we should not go through the woods but we should take the road, and that we have to, don't have to cross

39:06.988 --> 39:13.252
Bug now, we have to do it in the North, in Belarus, not in Ukraine. And that's why he went North, to

39:13.252 --> 39:18.639
Belarus, we crossed the Bug and at once got to the partisans, we joined the partisans.

39:18.640 --> 39:25.880
Can I ask him, he was alone with Sasha at that moment? He didn't stay with the others who escaped?

39:25.880 --> 39:26.539
But, er, well, when you went to cross the Bug, how many of you were

39:26.539 --> 39:27.160
there, you were there, Sasha was there, was there someone else?

39:27.160 --> 39:28.060
Seven people there were.

39:28.060 --> 39:28.680
There were seven.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.730
M-m, you splitted of from the big group in the woods?

39:30.730 --> 39:39.140
You, you separated from the larger group, that was in the woods, yes?

39:39.140 --> 39:39.140
Yes.

39:39.140 --> 39:39.250
Yes.

39:39.250 --> 39:44.570
Was that a difficult decision, to

39:46.950 --> 39:53.619
But well, the others crossed the Bug immediately, well, and these OUN people, er,

39:53.619 --> 39:59.630
led them away, all one after another, they killed them off, like Germans.

39:59.790 --> 40:06.714
M-m. And the rest, they crossed the Bug at once, and, they were killed by nationalists,

40:06.714 --> 40:11.650
by Ukrainian nationalists, who were killing them like Germans.

40:11.750 --> 40:14.680
How did they decide to split off with seven people, yeah?

40:14.680 --> 40:18.650
But how did you decide, well, with this group of seven, to separate?

40:18.650 --> 40:21.983
Well, right, this (was) not separating, we were going for reconnaissance,

40:21.983 --> 40:24.860
and then did not return back to the general, to the general [?]

40:24.860 --> 40:33.437
Er, we went for intelligence, and then we never came back

40:33.437 --> 40:40.660
to the main group. So that's how we split it up.

40:40.660 --> 40:42.960
You decided.

40:43.480 --> 40:48.860
They, they decided to go to see what's around and never came back.

40:48.860 --> 40:48.860
M-m. They really decided not to come back?

40:48.860 --> 40:51.200
? I don't remember, either seven or nine.

40:51.200 --> 40:57.591
You, well, from these then, did you decide then, that you

40:57.591 --> 41:03.310
wouldn't return, or did it just turn out like that?

41:05.120 --> 41:12.979
Well, it turned out like that, this Shubaev was saying, back we won't return, because

41:12.979 --> 41:20.100
we all perish. We must cross the Bug faster, and get to the partisans, right.

41:20.100 --> 41:26.328
It turned out so and, and Shubaev was saying all the time, that we are not coming back, because

41:26.328 --> 41:32.360
then we're all dead, and we have to cross the Bug and join the partisans as quick as we can.

41:32.360 --> 41:32.360
[cough]

41:32.360 --> 41:32.360
Thank you ve

41:32.360 --> 41:34.230
We got into this, well, right, the Frunze detachment, so it was called.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.040
We joined er partisan, er, group

41:35.040 --> 41:35.040
And they

41:35.040 --> 41:35.040
called Frunze group.

41:35.040 --> 41:51.372
I say, they said so, about three days we were there, er, he says, they

41:51.372 --> 42:07.937
of course did not kill (us), like in Ukraine, they said, Go east, cross

42:07.937 --> 42:22.870
the front, you cross, and join the army. But we don't need Jews.

42:22.870 --> 42:28.187
And we stayed for about three days with that partisan group, they of course

42:28.187 --> 42:33.575
were not killing us like it happened in Ukraine, but they said, You go east,

42:33.575 --> 42:38.680
you cross the frontline and you join the army. We do not need Jews here.

42:40.860 --> 42:41.340
Well. We headed.

42:41.340 --> 42:42.380
That, that must have been a shock.

42:42.380 --> 42:49.955
We headed east, and the reconnaissance of this detachment

42:49.955 --> 42:56.600
encircled us took our arms from us, and went away.

42:56.600 --> 43:03.720
And then, er, when we went eastwards, the intelligence groups of the those partisans took

43:03.940 --> 43:04.380
Pistols.

43:04.380 --> 43:06.400
away our weapons, and left.

43:06.400 --> 43:10.970
Were they Polish partisans or Russian partisans [?]. Russian partisans.

43:10.970 --> 43:11.250
M-m.

43:14.530 --> 43:17.270
They took away your weapons?

43:17.270 --> 43:19.250
They took away all arms from you?

43:25.690 --> 43:26.220
All arms, they took everything from us.

43:26.220 --> 43:26.220
Yes they took everything from us [?].

43:26.220 --> 43:36.420
And, er, we went farther. But we got to the transport unit of this Stalin brigade.

43:36.420 --> 43:36.900
M-m

43:36.900 --> 43:55.681
And they needed, er, these [?нездабрые?]. And they seated us on a cart,

43:55.681 --> 44:12.350
and with this transport unit we got to the brigade, the Stalin brigade.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.360
Er.

44:13.360 --> 44:22.960
And there, I say, we got to this Stalin brigade, and there they separated us. Sasha and yet another

44:22.960 --> 44:32.366
one, Naum, he was, er, ? from ? And he was a butcher, so they took him immediately into this, er,

44:32.366 --> 44:41.676
transport unit, well. In turn them two, er, they left them in the Shchors detachment. But in the

44:41.676 --> 44:50.210
Shchors detachment was a Jewish, er, Jewish, er, not a company but a unit, a Jewish one.

44:50.210 --> 44:51.450
Moment.

44:51.590 --> 44:59.582
M-m. Ah, so when they were walking afterwards they got to the rear transport of the Stalin brigade,

44:59.582 --> 45:07.171
so-called, and that rear brigade they had, they needed help. So they took them, with that rear

45:07.171 --> 45:13.550
unions they got to the main brigade and that's were they got separated, because

45:13.550 --> 45:14.280
But us, the others

45:14.280 --> 45:15.610
Moment, moment! Who got separated?

45:15.610 --> 45:18.220
Er, this group of, of seven people.

45:18.380 --> 45:19.110
Ja, with different people.

45:19.110 --> 45:25.422
Yes, yes. Er, Sasha, and another person, er, they were taken to the

45:25.422 --> 45:31.170
Stalin brigade, and the rest to the Shchors partisan brigade.

45:31.170 --> 45:40.870
But us, the others, five people, we were sent back to that! To the Frunze detachment,

45:40.870 --> 45:50.800
and we, er, showed up, I say, Take us into the partisans, and, well, clearly, we fought

45:50.800 --> 46:00.386
rather well afterwards. I was at first a second-number machine gunner, but when (we)

46:00.386 --> 46:08.490
united with the army I was commander of a machine-gun section, right-o.

46:08.490 --> 46:10.230
Moment.

46:10.230 --> 46:18.560
Er, so, they got separated, Sasha and the second guy, they went to this, er, Frunze brigade, which

46:18.560 --> 46:26.210
had a Jewish union, and the rest of five, they were sent back to that, er, Frunze brigade.

46:26.220 --> 46:26.490
Yeah.

46:26.490 --> 46:32.883
Er, but with an order now to take them as partisans. So, er, and afterwards, he

46:32.883 --> 46:39.277
says, they were good fighters, he was at first a second-number machine gun, and

46:39.277 --> 46:45.510
then, when they joined the army, he was the commander of a machine gun union.

46:45.830 --> 46:55.070
I do want to finish for today, but I have one question, can you say that?

46:55.070 --> 46:56.972
Er, we and you, we will soon finish already, probably, for today,

46:56.972 --> 46:58.640
but there is still one question to you. A final question.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.530
And then tomorrow I want to talk about after the war.

47:03.640 --> 47:06.540
But, tomorrow we will talk with you about what was after the war.

47:06.540 --> 47:07.560
I don't want him to get too tired.

47:07.560 --> 47:12.040
We don't want that you get very tired, that it is not hard for you.

47:12.040 --> 47:12.560
Er, er.

47:12.560 --> 47:16.700
There is a story, he tried to escape.

47:16.700 --> 47:27.790
I have a partisan booklet, this, a partisan’s certificate.

47:27.790 --> 47:28.660
I have a partisan passport.

47:28.660 --> 47:30.790
I have a, er, partisan of Belarus.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.930
Passport of Belorussian partisan.

47:32.930 --> 47:41.035
I want, er, there's a story, which I want to tell him. And I want him to reply to that. It

47:41.035 --> 47:48.600
is (the) story that he tried to escape with a group of men before the uprising. Yes.

47:48.600 --> 47:48.770
M-m.

47:48.770 --> 47:50.460
And he was forbidden to do so.

47:50.460 --> 47:50.460
M-m.

47:50.460 --> 47:55.620
Can he tell me if the story is true or not.

47:55.620 --> 48:05.933
M-m. Er, well, when she read about Sobibor, yes, she, er, found a story,

48:05.933 --> 48:16.819
in which it was said that you and a few other people wanted to escape before

48:16.819 --> 48:26.130
the uprising, but you were forbidden to. Is this true, or is this

48:26.130 --> 48:33.680
No, I say, it was like this. We wanted (to get) through this wire, get through [?]

48:34.170 --> 48:49.338
Er, well, right, of course they forbade us, they said that an uprising is being prepared,

48:49.338 --> 49:01.440
and you won't escape, er, separately, there wasn't something like that.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.790
Yes, the story is

49:05.790 --> 49:13.428
Well, but no, well, er, this was only talks. Not any preparations, well, (no) reconnaissance, there was

49:13.428 --> 49:21.066
nothing at all. These were talks, talks, well, well, a few people, us, they found out, Sasha found out,

49:21.066 --> 49:27.740
and he said, er, he sent for (us) and said, Don't do that, we will an, er, overall escape.

49:27.740 --> 49:33.932
M-m. But is was only talk, we never did anything to prepare it for real, we were just

49:33.932 --> 49:40.343
talking that we should go under the barbwire and escape, and when Sasha heard about that

49:40.343 --> 49:46.536
he called us and said that you mustn't do it because there is big uprising and if you

49:46.536 --> 49:51.999
try it you won't escape and you won't let others escape too because of you.

50:02.630 --> 50:03.370
Thank you.

50:06.430 --> 50:08.540
Thank you very much, thank you.

50:08.540 --> 50:14.220
It was just necessary to check the microphone.

50:14.220 --> 50:14.460
[coughs]

50:14.460 --> 50:14.770
Hello.

50:14.770 --> 50:14.910
[laughs]

50:14.910 --> 50:40.610
We hear you talking. Er, we had stopped yesterday, that you were joining the partisans.

50:40.610 --> 50:52.510
Yesterday we finished on the point where you joined the partisans

50:52.510 --> 50:52.920
Yes.

50:52.920 --> 50:53.150
after the war.

50:53.150 --> 50:53.150
Yes.

50:53.150 --> 51:04.840
Er, would you please talk about how you found the partisans and how it was to be with them?

51:04.840 --> 51:19.283
Can you tell a little bit about, well, how you joined this partisan detachment and how, er,

51:19.283 --> 51:33.410
which events happened there, how you felt, during participation in the partisan struggle.

51:33.410 --> 51:38.789
Well that, er well, at first, they would not take us at all into this detachment. But then from,

51:38.789 --> 51:44.224
er, the Stalin brigade they sent us that way, and, er, I for example, was appointed second-number

51:44.224 --> 51:49.491
machine gunner. Right. I participated in several events, we, er, with our machine gun, we went

51:49.491 --> 51:55.039
to a region of Ukraine to prepare provisions [grins] for our detachment, well [coughs]. Er, already

51:55.039 --> 52:00.698
within a couple of months there was an offensive, er, by the Polizei and the Germans into our region,

52:00.698 --> 52:06.133
so we, er, took the defence and our machine gun distinguished itself well on that (occasion), and

52:06.133 --> 52:09.719
after this I was appointed commander of the machine-gun section.

52:09.720 --> 52:09.930
Moment.

52:09.930 --> 52:18.652
Er, so at first he was, he was saying, he was not taken by the partisans, but then for the second

52:18.652 --> 52:27.914
time, when there was an order from the Stalin brigade, so to say, er, they were taken into the partisan

52:27.914 --> 52:36.907
union and, er, he was, er, second number machine gun. They had different things going on, they went,

52:36.907 --> 52:45.719
er, to Ukraine, for example to, to get foods for the partisan group. And also, in some months, the

52:45.719 --> 52:54.442
Germans and the police started attacking the region where the group was, and they had, er, better

52:54.442 --> 53:03.614
events with that Germans at, and his machine gun was taking, er, good care of that, so that afterwards

53:03.614 --> 53:09.010
he was given the rank of commander of the machine gun union.

53:09.840 --> 53:21.560
Was it still important he was a Jew?

53:21.560 --> 53:34.700
But did it play a role up to that time that you were a Jew?

53:34.700 --> 53:44.299
I don't think, but, yes, er, when they already accepted us, we (were) just like

53:44.299 --> 53:54.142
all, there was not any animosity, we didn't feel (any), in this detachment. Well,

53:54.142 --> 54:03.499
er, right, we were not, we were all experienced soldiers. We all participated

54:03.499 --> 54:11.520
in the war and endured a lot and we were not, how to say, er, like

54:11.520 --> 54:11.970
I

54:13.170 --> 54:16.936
not like, er, newcomers, knowing nothing at all, yet, we were experienced

54:16.936 --> 54:19.980
soldiers, and therefore the disposition to us was like that

54:19.980 --> 54:26.428
When we were taken into the union we were like anyone else, it did not match

54:26.428 --> 54:33.130
any more that we were Jewish, and also we were not young, we were soldiers, who

54:33.130 --> 54:39.070
had lots of experience, and that's why we also were taken back to them

54:39.070 --> 54:47.610
Could he talk about his experience? In Sobibor? Or did he never talk about it.

54:47.610 --> 54:56.880
But could you at that time talk about what had happened in Sobibor,

54:56.880 --> 55:05.460
or did you not mention it? While you were among the partisans.

55:05.460 --> 55:14.326
I'll tell you, no, no one was particularly interested. Not interested. Er, perhaps Sasha, er,

55:14.326 --> 55:23.384
was close to the leadership of this Stalin brigade, and he began immediately to take up contact

55:23.384 --> 55:32.727
with Ehrenburg and with others, Sasha began, and that would be for some(one) else. We lost contact

55:32.727 --> 55:41.594
with him, when we were already in this Frunze (detachment). He and I didn't keep in touch any

55:41.594 --> 55:50.937
more. And only already after the war we found each other again. He was occupied with these things,

55:50.937 --> 55:59.709
er, still from the partisans he contacted Ehrenburg and others, and told about, er, Sobibor.

55:59.709 --> 56:08.385
And there even appeared an article in, I think, the Komsomolskaya Pravda, about this, about

56:08.385 --> 56:13.820
the uprising in Sobibor, still before we joined the army.

56:13.820 --> 56:13.980
M-m.

56:13.980 --> 56:24.367
Er, so, no one was pretty much interested in what happened in Sobibor, and I did not talk much so no

56:24.367 --> 56:35.066
one was asking, er, but Sasha, who was closer to the Stalin brigade authorities, went into contact with

56:35.066 --> 56:45.557
Ehrenburg and others, other people who were interested, and he talked much to them, because, er, when

56:45.557 --> 56:56.153
I went to Frunze to the partisans and he was at Stalin brigade we lost touch, and er, we rejoined only

56:56.153 --> 57:07.267
after the war. But during that time he was making contacts and even one of the articles on Sobibor uprising

57:07.267 --> 57:15.370
appeared probably in Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, er, still during the war.

57:15.370 --> 57:16.310
Oh really, I didn't know that.

57:16.310 --> 57:19.020
Because Sasha was pressing much.

57:28.550 --> 57:36.646
Er, and can you talk ? about your time in, as a partisan?

57:36.646 --> 57:43.180
Did you stay in the same region, did you move?

57:43.180 --> 57:49.126
M-m. When you were among the partisans, did you stay in

57:49.126 --> 57:54.640
one region, did you move around, how did it happen?

57:54.640 --> 58:04.390
We were basically in our own region. We were basically in our own region. Only when our troops already

58:04.390 --> 58:14.522
occupied Western Ukraine, and our people and Belarus were (being) liberated, er, there was a big offensive

58:14.522 --> 58:23.890
of German troops towards our region and we were moving around, in short, retreating, all the time,

58:23.890 --> 58:33.353
and then crossed the border of Ukraine and joined the army in Ukraine. I say, we retreated from our

58:33.353 --> 58:40.810
region and the front, the front settled on the border of Ukraine with Belarus.

58:40.810 --> 58:48.095
We mostly stayed at our own region, er, but then later, when the Soviet army came, they

58:48.095 --> 58:55.297
first liberated Western Ukraine and the Belarus was not yet liberated. And the Germans

58:55.297 --> 59:02.498
started a big attack and then we had to retreat and retreat, and we joined the army in

59:02.498 --> 59:10.538
Ukraine, and then the border between the German occupation and the Soviet army was approximately

59:10.538 --> 59:16.400
the Ukrainian border. And at that border they joined the regular army.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.890
M-m. Okay, and then?

59:29.800 --> 59:39.800
But then what happened, when you joined the army?

59:39.800 --> 59:59.570
Well, we joined, er, our units were disbanded and handed over to, er, units of the army.

59:59.570 --> 01:00:06.627
I got into, er, a machine-gun battalion, (there) was a battalion, and then, I say, er, into a training

01:00:06.627 --> 01:00:13.615
company, and then they left me training machine gunners. I hang around there, how to say, in short, a

01:00:13.615 --> 01:00:20.534
couple of months, I was teaching machine gunners, in the army, but then I got (involved) in forcing,

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:26.900
already got (involved) in, in forward position got (involved) in forcing the Oder, the Oder.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.450
M-m.

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:36.790
So, when we joined the army the partisan union was totally reformed, the people were sent to different

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:44.721
units of the regular army. I was sent to a machine gun battalion, where I was for some time, then

01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:52.652
for several months I was teaching young soldiers to use the machine gun. And afterwards I went to

01:00:52.652 --> 01:00:59.930
the front and I was taking part in the liberation of Oder, the Oder, in forcing the Oder.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:00.610
Order?

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.320
The river, the river.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.790
OK, and then you crossed the Oder?

01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:08.010
And then you crossed the Oder?

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:13.740
Well, yes, of course

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.280
Of course.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.930
I finished, er, the war in Wismar.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:15.930
I understand.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:15.930
Yes.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:28.080
Er, and did he participate in the liberation of Jews and Jewish camps?

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:37.510
But did you somehow participate in the liberation of Jewish camps, or did you see any Jews?

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:43.022
No, I didn't come across. I think, er, I think by then I didn't even know that there

01:01:43.022 --> 01:01:48.010
were Jewish camps, I think we thought they had all been annihilated already.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:51.731
N-n-no, I met no one, and I didn't even know that the Jewish camps

01:01:51.731 --> 01:01:54.890
exist, we thought that everyone was killed by that time.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.890
M-m.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.890
the camps were annihilated.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.890
M-m.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:02:01.230
What does he say?

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.460
He is saying that he means that the camps were destroyed.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:11.740
Yes, I understood already, yes, er, I can, that you can see here between the lines.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:11.740
M-m.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:21.996
Er, so, was it a hard life in the Russian army, was it we hear stories it was a very

01:02:21.996 --> 01:02:31.520
hard life, was it hard in the partisans, was it hard in the army, can you compare?

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.072
M-m, well, if you compare, was it harder with the partisans, or harder

01:02:33.072 --> 01:02:34.668
in the army? Because, well, she has heard that, well, in the army it was

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.110
very hard, in the Russian, but well, if you compare how you felt.

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:45.011
It was hard in captivity. Er, in the army it was like this as it was

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:54.567
for all and, of course, serving there was hard. But it cannot be compared

01:02:54.567 --> 01:03:02.160
with captivity, er, let alone with the concentration camp.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.205
It was hard in captivity not in the army, and er, in the army it was like for everyone

01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:11.430
and you cannot compare it to the captivity or to the concentration camp.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:22.858
Please tell him that I do understand he assumed that people

01:03:22.858 --> 01:03:33.900
were killed, that I understand, that I really understand.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.070
M-m.

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:34.070
Please tell him.

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:34.070
She understands, well, what you said, that you thought that all had

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:34.070
already long, all camps had already long ago been annihilated

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:34.070
Yes.

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:39.650
and that the people had perished already. She understands this well.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.650
Yes.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:40.560
I understand why he couldn't believe that people had survived [?].

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:47.619
And why it was so difficult to believe that someone still survived

01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:52.860
after the Germans, that someone had stayed alive.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:53.140
Tell him.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:04:04.725
Well, we thought that we were left over by accident, this [?траки?] there is, we didn't even

01:04:04.725 --> 01:04:16.310
think that so many had stayed alive, I thought these seven people with whom we were, (that's it),

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:28.014
but still there were probably left some fifty or more people, saved from, er, from the camp. Many,

01:04:28.014 --> 01:04:37.450
many already perished in Poland, quite a lot were killed by Poles, and many got

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:52.564
to Ukraine and they were killed after this, well er, in short, er, there

01:04:52.564 --> 01:05:07.050
was such such a feeling that, wherever we get, we don't belong there.

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:14.514
We also thought that we were the only seven who survived and that everyone else was killed,

01:05:14.514 --> 01:05:22.143
pretty much by chance that the seven of us survived, I only later got to know that there were

01:05:22.143 --> 01:05:29.444
more people who, who survived, like about thirty, a, or fifty, and then, some were killed

01:05:29.444 --> 01:05:37.155
by Poles, some got the Ukraine were killed, and many were killed during the war. But whenever,

01:05:37.155 --> 01:05:42.980
whenever we went, we felt we're not, er, we're others. We're different.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.100
And alone, I assume.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:48.290
And, and probably lonely, yes, not just strangers, but also loners, she thinks.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:49.570
No, just strangers.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.250
Nu, rather enemies than lonely.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:54.250
Loners, m-m.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.190
The strangers.

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:26.040
Strangers, yes. Yes. So where was he when the war ended?

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:38.930
Where were you when the war ended?

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:50.320
When the war was coming to its end, we were stationed in Wismar.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.590
In Wismar, Wismar he was when the war ended.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.240
And then?

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:58.600
And then?

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.382
sighs Er, then? What then, I already don't remember where we went

01:07:03.382 --> 01:07:07.870
after that. Mmmm, where were we stationed in the final period

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:08.920
He can't remember the place.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:17.109
Well I was, er, sergeant major of the company, in the final period, well, and then we were separated,

01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:25.136
those from (19)21 and older, I say, were liable to the first demobilization, well, so (they) almost

01:07:25.136 --> 01:07:33.244
didn't participate in instruction. There we fulfilled our duties, I was given an assistant, er, as a

01:07:33.244 --> 01:07:41.758
sergeant major, I introduced him to the current affairs, well, to the work of a company's sergeant major,

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:48.650
well and so, (a few) months, some six months perhaps, until we, er, were demobilized.

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:58.503
So, I was head of compartment, and for about six months we stayed somewhere

01:07:58.503 --> 01:08:08.881
around, we had to fulfil our functions, I had an accomplice whom I had to teach

01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:17.290
what and where, and then everyone who was born in 1921 or before

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:18.850
Basically

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:19.000
were demobilized.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.985
Basically, basically we were busy with instructing the reinforcements that came, er,

01:08:24.985 --> 01:08:30.400
'27, 1927 was drafted and we kept ourselves busy with, er, instructing them.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.775
We mostly had to teach the newcomers, born in 1927, and then, er, as I

01:08:35.775 --> 01:08:40.920
said, they had to be all demobilized, because they were old enough.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:40.920
M-m, and where did you go?

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:40.920
When?

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:40.920
After he was demobilized.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.040
M-m. And where did you go after the demobilization?

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.560
sighs I didn't know, didn't know where to go.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:45.820
Didn't know where to go.

01:08:45.820 --> 01:09:02.521
Such was ? the time. Still when a partisan I sent a letter to our village and received an

01:09:02.521 --> 01:09:19.223
answer that all those near to me had perished, and, er, I knew that I had no one. I came,

01:09:19.223 --> 01:09:35.550
came to my village when I was demobilized, well but there I found out that in Zaporozhe

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:36.660
lived cousins of my father. Cousins

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:37.190
M-m.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:55.988
of my father. Well, and I went that way, found out about their address, went to them. Er, on the

01:09:55.988 --> 01:10:13.117
whole they very much loved my father, I say, er, these, er, maternal cousins. Well And They wanted

01:10:13.117 --> 01:10:29.895
to get me as a teacher in the village, in ours. I had finished ten-year school with distinction,

01:10:29.895 --> 01:10:46.849
I was, in short, I had studied well, right but then I consulted my father's cousin and I say that

01:10:46.849 --> 01:11:04.327
I will work as a tutor and want to go to college. To study. But I didn't have any documents. Neither

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:22.154
this, nor that (document) on having finished ten-year school and everything. This cousin had graduated

01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:38.758
from a teacher training college in Zaporozhe. He went to the rector and said, Look, my relative

01:11:38.758 --> 01:11:56.061
was in the army, he studied very well, and finished ten-year school with distinction, and he hasn't

01:11:56.061 --> 01:12:05.500
any documents, how can we get him into (this) college?

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:05.500
Moment, moment.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:13.031
Er, so, I did not know where to go, because, back when I was in partisans I sent a letter to my

01:12:13.031 --> 01:12:20.643
village and I got an answer that everyone I knew was killed, so I first came back to the village

01:12:20.643 --> 01:12:28.174
and then I knew that in, er, in Kherson, in Zaporozhe, there were second brothers of, er, of my

01:12:28.174 --> 01:12:35.865
father, on the mother's side, and then, er, I came there I knew the address, I came to them, they

01:12:35.865 --> 01:12:43.555
liked my father very much, and, er, at first, they wanted me to become teacher, because I had ten

01:12:43.555 --> 01:12:51.246
grades of education, with excellent education, er, and then I decided I would do private lessons,

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:58.857
and then to enter institute, or university, to get higher education, but I had no documents, not

01:12:58.857 --> 01:13:06.468
any documents, that I finished ten grades or anything, so that brother went to rector, and asked

01:13:06.468 --> 01:13:11.859
what to do and how, because this is the guy and he has no documents.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:11.860
And

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:27.670
But, and to the rector, or what?

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:38.680
I went to Kalinindorf, again, and there at school the teachers were my former students, er, fellow-students,

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:49.080
and they, I say, well, they wrote such a document that, they didn't have copies of diplomas there, but

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:59.683
the teachers confirm that he really finished there in, er, '39, I think, finished ten-year school, well,

01:13:59.683 --> 01:14:10.286
with distinction, and signed. And by this document I got into the college. Well, already the first grade

01:14:10.286 --> 01:14:20.481
I immediately finished with distinction, the first semester. In this college all the time my picture

01:14:20.481 --> 01:14:31.084
hung as (one of) the best students, well, and on the whole I was a very good mathematician, right. Well,

01:14:31.084 --> 01:14:37.100
and I graduated from the college with distinction, as well.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:56.713
So I had no documents and I had to go back to, to my village and at school there worked my former

01:14:56.713 --> 01:15:05.073
classmates. Of course they did not have any documents, but they made a letter, saying that I

01:15:05.073 --> 01:15:13.796
graduated together with them in 1939, was it, and they signed that letter, and using that letter

01:15:13.796 --> 01:15:22.156
I got to the university. I was studying with honours, I was a very good mathematician and my

01:15:22.156 --> 01:15:28.880
picture was on the award desk all the time and thus I finished university.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:44.728
Er, I already studied in college, (when) I received a letter from a girl from our village, well,

01:15:44.728 --> 01:16:00.246
who was studying one grade below mine. I was in tenth class, she was in the ninth. But she was

01:16:00.246 --> 01:16:15.599
studying in a Ukrainian school. Er, in [?березноватой?] like that, it was called.

01:16:15.599 --> 01:16:30.787
Well. Her father was working at the oil factory I don't know, he was a specialist. Well. She

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:46.966
was studying in Kharkov when the war began. And when our district was occupied she dropped college

01:16:46.966 --> 01:17:02.484
and went to the Donbass, there in the Donbass lived an uncle of hers she had, a brother of her

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:12.390
mother. And with this uncle she was evacuated to Uzbekistan.

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.570
M-m.

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:12.630
Speak.

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:21.198
So when I was already in the university I received a letter from a girl, er, whom I knew she was studying

01:17:21.198 --> 01:17:29.441
at school, she was one year younger than me, er, but she was studying in a Ukrainian school, and when

01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:37.846
the war began, er, she was studying in Kharkiv, er, then she left university and went to Donbass, where

01:17:37.846 --> 01:17:44.620
her uncle was, and after they were both evacuated. So I received a letter from her.

01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:10.774
So, well, after the first grade I came, they had already returned from evacuation, and they lived again

01:18:10.774 --> 01:18:23.711
in the Donbass. All her parents, her parents and relatives had perished as well, she was also lonely,

01:18:23.711 --> 01:18:36.649
well, she was only with this uncle of hers, well, I went to her, right, and we married, and er, lived

01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:47.410
together, more than fifty years. She died in, '03, in '04, in '04, in 2004 she died.

01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:56.314
So she was also, er, lonely and after the first year in the university they returned from evacuation

01:18:56.314 --> 01:19:05.040
and went to her, er, we got married, we lived together over fifty years happily, she died in 2004.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.750
He says he was lonely. Er

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:11.110
She was also very lonely.

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.310
Ja, but

01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:13.640
Because every, all her relatives were killed, and

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:35.520
Sure, but he says he was lonely. Did he think of Sobibor, did he have nightmares of that period?

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:43.180
M-m.

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.600
He had a special past, er

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.383
M-m, you said that you were lonely then, you felt lonely, were left alone. But

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:49.212
did you have any (specific) thoughts about Sobibor at that time, perhaps you had

01:19:49.212 --> 01:19:50.789
certain bad dreams, or didn't you have, or didn't you think about it?

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:59.185
Well, about Sobibor, er, I had experiences during wartime, a lot. Er, in Sobibor I

01:19:59.185 --> 01:20:06.913
was a month in all, of course that was a huge experience, in Sobibor, but this was,

01:20:06.913 --> 01:20:13.990
er, one out of (many) wartime experiences, I didn’t exactly single it out.

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:18.910
M-m. I had many impressions during the war, and I was only one month

01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:24.048
in Sobibor, it was of course a very big impression but I did not single

01:20:24.048 --> 01:20:28.390
it out from many other impressions I got during the wartime.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.150
Are there impressions which are as dreadful as Sobibor?

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:31.150
But, were there, well, specific memories or events that

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:31.150
were as dreadful as Sobibor during the war for you?

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:31.899
Well, so, I was on the first, when in the hospital for prisoners of war, in the hospital for prisoners

01:20:31.899 --> 01:20:32.611
of war the deputy head of the hospital appeared to be a Jew. And after that they did a full check

01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:33.339
for Jewry in the hospital. Already then I was, er, I had a leg broken in two places, well, er, this

01:20:33.339 --> 01:20:34.059
had already grown together with me, I even worked as an orderly in this hospital. And some seventy

01:20:34.059 --> 01:20:34.793
people of us were revealed as Jews, and, er, more than half of the staff, er, of doctors and medical

01:20:34.793 --> 01:20:35.513
attendants appeared to be Jews. And we were put, this hospital was situated near a forest camp, as

01:20:35.513 --> 01:20:36.255
it was called, but (we were put) in an evacuation camp, er, from which the prisoners of war were sent

01:20:36.255 --> 01:20:36.990
to Germany. Well. And they put us all in a cell, an underground cell. And it was so narrow, we would

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.710
turn to the other side on command. Well. They would give hundred, hundred and fifty grams of bread

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:38.437
once and on top of that balanda every other day. Well, balanda it was called, this brownish thingy.

01:20:38.437 --> 01:20:39.172
Soup with a couple of potatoes, there would float some. Well. And we were told that there was a note

01:20:39.172 --> 01:20:39.892
by Molotov that the Germans are killing our prisoners of war. If this will continue, I say, er, we

01:20:39.892 --> 01:20:40.619
will act likewise, he says, with Germans. And, well, therefore, they say, we are not going to shoot

01:20:40.619 --> 01:20:40.950
you, but you will die here of hunger. Slowly.

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.950
Moment.

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:45.064
Er, so, back when I was in hospital for prisoners of war, er, I remember it only turned out that the

01:20:45.064 --> 01:20:49.178
deputy head of that hospital was Jewish. And then the Germans made an inspection for Jewishness. And

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:53.374
it turned out that there were, er, about seventy people who were Jewish and many of them were doctors.

01:20:53.374 --> 01:20:57.529
At that time I was wounded, my leg was broken in two places but by that time I was well, so they took

01:20:57.529 --> 01:21:01.150
us all and they put us in, er. There was a camp, a forest camp, er, and it had a carcer,

01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:01.455
we were all put there under the ground, it was very, small space, we had to turn all together if

01:21:01.455 --> 01:21:01.766
we were to turn, we were given very little food, some porridge and a bit of bread and we were told

01:21:01.766 --> 01:21:02.074
that there was a note by Molotov that the Germans are killing our Soviet prisoners of war, and if

01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:02.389
they don't stop it, Soviets will start killing German prisoners of war. So they were told that they

01:21:02.389 --> 01:21:02.650
are not executed because of that note and now they would be left to die of hunger.

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:02.650
And how long did you stay there?

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:02.650
How long were you kept in that cell?

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:05.669
And there, there we stayed, when already less than half of us was left suddenly we were led

01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:08.722
out and lined up and sent somewhere. It appeared, we were brought to Minsk to the camp, this

01:21:08.722 --> 01:21:11.742
one, and well we were deported, to this Minsk concentration camp. There was, er, a camp for

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:14.828
Jewish prisoners of war. Well, by that time still there were also non-Jews as well. But then,

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:17.550
then they were deported, the final period there were only, only Jews in this camp.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.550
And when

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:18.237
Well, there I was so thin, well, like, see, you have in pictures, see, in pictures, on the whole I

01:21:18.237 --> 01:21:18.924
was young-looking, like a young, well, er, and I didn't swell up, and so thin, like, er, legs like

01:21:18.924 --> 01:21:19.625
sticks. Right, and this way I provoked such compassion in people, and this Blatman, who assigned the

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:20.327
jobs, sent me into this [?себерсау?], [?семфаустский?] court, there worked a lot

01:21:20.327 --> 01:21:21.021
of German Jews. And I was transferred to there, and I was sent to this boiler-house, I didn't work,

01:21:21.021 --> 01:21:21.722
and the German Jews there, er, would take something out and give it to me, I got alive a little, and

01:21:21.722 --> 01:21:22.424
er, then I was already sent to other jobs. Well, and I, er, had become more, er, strong, er, at that

01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:22.949
point, when we were deported to Sobibor I was full, a fully healthy person.

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:23.240
Moment.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:23.906
Er, so when less than half of us remained, we were all taken to, er, Minsk camp, at first there

01:21:23.906 --> 01:21:24.566
were not only Jews, but later only Jews, and I was thin like the pictures you can see from the

01:21:24.566 --> 01:21:25.240
war, my legs were like sticks. And, er, the Blatman guy who was, er, selecting for jobs, he sent

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:25.914
me to some court where German Jews were working, and they were very sympathetic with me, I would

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:26.566
be brought there, then sent to a boiler and I did not work there, I rested and sometimes they

01:21:26.566 --> 01:21:27.233
gave me some food and that's the way I recovered, er, to, to the point when we were all sent to

01:21:27.233 --> 01:21:27.760
Sobibor I was more or less recovered from, from that carcer, incarceration.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:27.760
That must have been a horrible experience.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.020
This was probably a very hard memory, of course.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:28.590
Well, goo

01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:29.190
This cell.

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:59.046
What, there were quite a lot of cases, well, yet another case I

01:21:59.046 --> 01:22:28.430
had, also there. When I worked, the head would say, there were

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.910
00:40:00]

01:22:28.920 --> 01:23:22.891
four of us, four together, we, er, lived together, four people, so well, I, this, er, Zyamka worked

01:23:22.891 --> 01:24:18.497
at the gendarmerie, there was such a commando, we and Fimka worked at, how was it called, the commando

01:24:18.497 --> 01:25:11.378
for something, I forgot, in short, we worked with the stove-repairer. And there was another group

01:25:11.378 --> 01:26:06.440
of ours working (at the) power-saw bench. We sawed wood, and chopped. But there was another commando,

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:59.866
Truppenwirtschaftslager, this was the most prestigious one with us, there worked dockers, and they

01:26:59.866 --> 01:27:52.746
in point of fact fed the whole camp, 'cause they brought in, well, food-stuffs like potatoes, and

01:27:52.746 --> 01:28:45.082
gave them away and particularly to those who were in need of them, well, this is so. So you see,

01:28:45.082 --> 01:29:37.418
this group, there were healthy guys, good-lookers were they, and they linked with one Ukrainian,

01:29:37.418 --> 01:30:30.844
and they agreed there, I say, at the arms depot, they stole weapons, and they agreed with him that

01:30:30.844 --> 01:31:07.370
he would bring them somewhere as if to work and they would run away

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:07.580
Moment.

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:45.820
to the partisans.

01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.000
Moment.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:56.894
Er, so on another case, he remembered, yesterday I told you that there were four of us living together

01:31:56.894 --> 01:32:07.041
in one room, and we had different groups at that camp, er, some were into the gendarmerie, some

01:32:07.041 --> 01:32:17.402
on the woods, er, some were loaders and they who were giving food practically to everyone because

01:32:17.402 --> 01:32:28.190
they had a chance to steal, er, so I remember that the loaders, they got connected to some Ukrainian,

01:32:28.190 --> 01:32:38.444
er, they stole weapons from, er, a storage, and so he had to bring them somewhere as if to work,

01:32:38.444 --> 01:32:45.280
and then they had to escape, they wanted to escape. In this way.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:45.910
Er, yes.

01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:51.760
You told, er, in which group, commando I was?

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:51.760
Yes, yes, yes.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:33:06.706
So, well, this Polizei betrayed them, and when they were loading the weapons they were

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:21.826
encircled, and there, straight on the spot, all were shot. And apart from that, whoever

01:33:21.826 --> 01:33:34.340
was in the court at that time, from other, er, commandos, was also shot.

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:44.851
And this Zyamka for some or another reason happened to be in the court and he was shot. But we were

01:33:44.851 --> 01:33:55.574
working at the power-saw bench. So, this power-saw bench was in the court. We were with seven people.

01:33:55.574 --> 01:34:06.192
But Fimka worked at the stove-repairer's, he cooked potatoes and called me, er, sent for me to come.

01:34:06.192 --> 01:34:16.703
I went during the break, I went to him to eat. But the other six people straight there were already

01:34:16.703 --> 01:34:27.320
shot. And a German came there, where I was, and at this stove-repairer's, Aren't there any strangers

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:35.390
here with you? He looked at him, No! That was all, and they didn't touch me.

01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.550
M-m.

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:43.040
And then with us, well, these others were brought into the camp, well, but all others were shot.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:43.490
Moment.

01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:50.300
So, they were, er, for he was in that room, but when, as the story goes, that police

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:56.810
guy, Ukrainian, he betrayed them and at a some point in a court they were all, er

01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:57.820
Shot.

01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:06.705
they were all taken by the Germans and shot, but also every one who was in that court at that point

01:35:06.705 --> 01:35:15.501
from all other brigades, it did not matter, they were also shot. And the matter is that one of our

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:24.477
four guys was shot, there, and at that time I was working at the sawery, er, cutting wood, and there

01:35:24.477 --> 01:35:33.362
were seven of us working also near that court. During the break, er, one of our colleagues who were

01:35:33.362 --> 01:35:41.979
was working together with that at the other guy, he told me that I can come because he made some

01:35:41.979 --> 01:35:50.685
potatoes. And so during the break I went to him and the rest six people were executed at the same

01:35:50.685 --> 01:35:59.481
point. And the Germans went to that premises where I was, my friend who called me and that guy who

01:35:59.481 --> 01:36:08.007
worked with the ovens, he asked if there is anyone strange in, er, not belonging to this group,

01:36:08.007 --> 01:36:16.534
and the head of us said, No, everyone here is, er, belongs here. And that's how I survived that

01:36:16.534 --> 01:36:21.830
part. And after we were all sent to the concentration camp.

01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:22.240
I understand.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.080
Well, who also ? they appeared to be.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:30.310
He was inch away from death.

01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:31.400
Yes. You were lucky.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.150
You were very lucky there.

01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:35.320
Enough! Enough with (those) coincidences!

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.890
Is that enough with the stories!

01:36:38.890 --> 01:36:38.890
[laughs]

01:36:38.890 --> 01:36:46.819
I wanted to come back, if he allows me, to after the war was finished. Did he also go

01:36:46.819 --> 01:36:54.190
to look for his friends, er, Pechersky and the other guys with whom he escaped?

01:36:54.190 --> 01:36:59.051
M-m. If possible, we will now go back to the moment when the war was over, see, when it was

01:36:59.051 --> 01:37:03.860
over, did you try to find Sasha and other people with whom you escaped from the camp then?

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:19.036
[coughs] I want, er, tell you a little bit more. I was lucky somehow, during the period of captivity

01:37:19.036 --> 01:37:34.820
and er, well, in these concentration camps. It did not happen even once that I was beaten up. There were

01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:50.452
? something, twenty-five there, what's that, in particular. Well, but me they somehow didn't ever (beat

01:37:50.452 --> 01:38:06.236
up), (perhaps it was) I had such looks, non, er, non-opposing. Well, somehow I was lucky, I would almost

01:38:06.236 --> 01:38:21.413
say. Well, right, this (is how it is). I say I haven't sought no one, but only Sasha found me as the

01:38:21.413 --> 01:38:36.590
first. Sasha, er, he had my address at the colony, and he wrote to this, er, our village, that he is

01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:52.070
searching for, in short, Arkadii Weisspapier. Well. And from there they wrote to me to that college in

01:38:52.070 --> 01:39:08.461
Zaporozhe that you are being searched for from, er, Rostov by, er, Alexander Pechersky. Here is his address.

01:39:08.461 --> 01:39:18.629
I wrote to him that I'm alive, so, well, the first he found was me.

01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:18.690
M-m

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:25.754
So back in the wartime I want to mention that it seems I was very lucky, because I was never beaten

01:39:25.754 --> 01:39:32.401
up during the wartime, many people were, and I wasn't. Maybe I had some special looks or something

01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:39.116
but anyway I was very, very happy, and very lucky not to be beaten up. And coming to your question,

01:39:39.116 --> 01:39:45.898
I was not looking for anyone but, er, Sasha found me first, because he wrote a letter to my village,

01:39:45.898 --> 01:39:52.477
he had the address of my village, where I used to live before the war, and from that village they

01:39:52.477 --> 01:39:58.920
sent a letter to the institute, in Zaporozhe, saying that, er, from Rostov, Alexander Pechersky

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:05.635
is looking for you, and there was an address, and that's in this way I was the first whom he found,

01:40:05.635 --> 01:40:09.230
'cause I responded to the letter and we got in touch.

01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:16.010
And you married. Can you talk about the years that followed? Er, yes?

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:19.256
M-m. But well, when you married, er, can you tell a little bit about those years, well,

01:40:19.256 --> 01:40:22.280
after the wedding, after the wedding, what happened, well, after you got married?

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:35.860
Which wedding? There was no wedding at all [laughs], we got married and, well, that was it.

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:49.589
And she worked as a teacher, well, she ? me, she helped me. She didn't earn very much, well,

01:40:49.589 --> 01:41:03.467
right, er, during the years, during the semester she would dry rusks and I would take (those)

01:41:03.467 --> 01:41:17.346
rusks with me, er, when I was going to the first lecture, er, to study. Well, right. A little

01:41:17.346 --> 01:41:31.075
bit, in summer, in summer I would be at her uncle's, there we would eat well, of course, but

01:41:31.075 --> 01:41:41.820
hard it was, of course. Right, but then I got work and we lived not bad.

01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:48.886
M. Er, so we had no special ceremony of course, er, but when we got married she helped

01:41:48.886 --> 01:41:55.789
me much, for example, er, she dried bread, and I would take that dried bread with me

01:41:55.789 --> 01:42:03.184
when I went to studies in Zaporozhe, and then in summer, er, I spent the summer in Donbass

01:42:03.184 --> 01:42:10.334
at her uncle's place, and we had some food there, she was working as a teacher, she did

01:42:10.334 --> 01:42:17.483
not earn much, but still she helped me somehow, and after I graduated at the university

01:42:17.483 --> 01:42:22.660
I started to work myself and, well, we lived more or less well.

01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:30.340
When did he come to Kiev?

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:44.870
When did you come to Kiev?

01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:59.678
To Kiev I came already for my son. I say, I worked well in this [coughs], er, at first, well

01:42:59.678 --> 01:43:14.648
? When, I say, I finished college, I first worked in Lugansk, I worked as a shop foreman, and

01:43:14.648 --> 01:43:28.170
then, when Khrushchev came, they sent, er, all young specialists to the countryside.

01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:28.170
M-m.

01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:31.749
I was everywhere and always getting in all [laughs] (such) events [laughs], and,

01:43:31.749 --> 01:43:35.239
in short, I was sent to Bryansk province, I worked as a deputy shop foreman in

01:43:35.239 --> 01:43:38.549
an MTS (Machine and Tractor Station), well I worked there for three years.

01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:43.426
But then I left, I worked in Artyomovsk at a factory, as head of the

01:43:43.426 --> 01:43:47.730
technical department. You tell, or afterwards you'll forget.

01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:56.722
M-m. Good, thanks. Er, to Kiev I already came to my son. Because when I graduated university I first

01:43:56.722 --> 01:44:05.714
worked in Lugansk, er, at a power plant, as head of the workers' union. Then, er, I, when Khrushchev

01:44:05.714 --> 01:44:14.526
came, they were all kind of events, and to all of these events I was taken, and I went to villages

01:44:14.526 --> 01:44:21.630
in Bryansk region, and then, er, back I worked in Artyomovsk, on another plant.

01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:27.300
Did he, er, was he bothered by Soviet anti-Semitism?

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:32.310
Did you somehow feel Soviet anti-Semitism yourself?

01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:59.983
sighs I have to tell you about one fact in my life that I didn't want to touch on. There's been a very

01:44:59.983 --> 01:45:27.114
dreadful thing in my life. In 1938 my father was repressed. He was alleged to have been a Zionist in

01:45:27.114 --> 01:45:55.059
1920. And he, apparently, er, I got a letter that he was convicted to ten years, but well, he was shot.

01:45:55.059 --> 01:46:17.850
So apart from, er, being a Jew I was also the son of an enemy of the people. Say it.

01:46:17.850 --> 01:46:29.719
So, er, I will have to tell you something about my life that I did not intend to tell, first,

01:46:29.719 --> 01:46:41.588
er, in 1938 my father was repressed. He was falsely accused of being a Zionist somewhere back

01:46:41.588 --> 01:46:54.095
in the twenties. And I was told that he got ten years of imprisonment but he was in fact executed.

01:46:54.095 --> 01:47:04.050
So I was first of all a Jew and secondly son of a repressed person. I said it.

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:04.820
Go on.

01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:17.847
And so, I [coughs] worked at the Artyomovsk factory as head of the technical department, then I

01:47:17.847 --> 01:47:31.423
was deputy chief technology officer of the factory, and then, when our factory director was elected

01:47:31.423 --> 01:47:44.313
[coughs], er, president of the City Executive Board, I was acting director. But I could not be

01:47:44.313 --> 01:47:58.163
appointed director, because I was, well, er, a son of. Er, they already wanted to confirm my position

01:47:58.163 --> 01:48:11.464
as director, but they kept saying, you had to join the party. I said that, er, I had a father who

01:48:11.464 --> 01:48:25.177
was repressed and that they wouldn't take me. “Hand in your application and they will take you.”

01:48:25.177 --> 01:48:33.679
Well, I handed in the application and was taken as a candidate

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:46.743
and then, when I should already have been confirmed as, er, party member [coughs], well, I thought, er,

01:48:46.743 --> 01:48:58.920
in short, I was taken into the party at the meeting, but the regional committee did not confirm.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.560
M-m.

01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:18.843
And so I was excluded from, er, the candidates. Well, they said, you keep working

01:49:18.843 --> 01:49:37.210
as chief technology officer. Then I decided on the spot to leave this factory.

01:49:37.210 --> 01:49:37.540
M-m.

01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:37.710
Moment.

01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:45.808
So, when I was working in Artyomovsk, I was first of all head of technical department, and then

01:49:45.808 --> 01:49:53.566
main engineer. And then at some point our director was elected to the administration, and I

01:49:53.566 --> 01:50:01.324
had to fulfil the position of deputy director. And at some point I could have been made the

01:50:01.324 --> 01:50:09.422
director of that industry, er, but for that I had to be party member. And I said that my father

01:50:09.422 --> 01:50:17.436
was repressed and they would not take me to the party. And the administration replied that you

01:50:17.436 --> 01:50:25.194
fill in the form and apply for it, they should. So I filled out the form, they took me as a

01:50:25.194 --> 01:50:33.122
candidate to the party, and then the local party meeting, er, joined me to the party. But the

01:50:33.122 --> 01:50:40.965
regional one declined, and I was excluded from the candidates to the party, and they told me

01:50:40.965 --> 01:50:48.723
you're working as a main engineer and you should be staying working as a main engineer. And

01:50:48.723 --> 01:50:54.520
after that I decided to quit the job and go away from that industry.

01:50:59.270 --> 01:51:05.833
Well sniffs I had a good acquaintance working in our technical department, er, an engineer. His

01:51:05.833 --> 01:51:12.120
father worked in Donetsk in, er, how was it called then, well, the holding administration ]

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:12.250
M-m.

01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:12.450
in a People's Holding Council.

01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:12.450
M-m.

01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:27.967
Well. And he took me to Donetsk, er, as head of transport management. And I don't

01:51:27.967 --> 01:51:42.910
know, in short, I was transferred to Donetsk, they made me head of management.

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:43.940
M-m. So ]

01:51:43.940 --> 01:52:12.717
Well, there I also was immediately given a good flat, well, a nice one, all right. We lived

01:52:12.717 --> 01:52:37.700
fine, financially, and both my sons studied there. This was the last job I had.

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:45.638
Mm. So, then I knew one of the engineers, who had relatives in Donetsk in Sovnarkhoz,

01:52:45.638 --> 01:52:53.483
so called the, er, also another employment. And he, I was transferred there, as head

01:52:53.483 --> 01:53:01.047
of transport department, and I was given a good apartment and it was good salary,

01:53:01.047 --> 01:53:08.612
and that's the place where I stayed, and where I worked, till, well, er. That was

01:53:08.612 --> 01:53:15.150
my last working place and my both sons studied there too in that city.

01:53:15.150 --> 01:53:21.690
Did he ever talk about the war?

01:53:21.690 --> 01:53:22.900
When?

01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:22.900
After that ]

01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.280
Mm.

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:37.030
Did he have chance to talk about the war, or ]

01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.960
About the war ]

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:37.960
Yeah.

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:49.240
Mm. Er, did you, well, afterwards, often talk about the war?

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:56.350
Well, with whom? I just didn't try to tell it ? to anyone. Later there were these correspondents, er,

01:53:56.350 --> 01:54:03.250
I would tell everything, but, er, er, the way I told you just now I never told to anyone [laughs].

01:54:03.250 --> 01:54:09.083
Er, I was not very much willing to talk, of course, if some

01:54:09.083 --> 01:54:14.620
journalists came and asked I would be telling something.

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.840
Now already, I'm saying to Olga, before my death [laughs].

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.389
Er, I haven't been telling that of course to anyone like I do

01:54:19.389 --> 01:54:21.730
now to you, and it's now like before death I'm speaking.

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:33.780
time, I didn't tell about my father, no, I didn't. And I didn't write it down

01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:46.457
in documents, after the war, I studied and, er, got a job, and no, er. But later,

01:54:46.457 --> 01:54:58.664
already when this rehabilitation began, then I only applied, er, for my father

01:54:58.664 --> 01:55:08.680
to be rehabilitated. Well. Right, and I got this rehabilitation.

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:09.920
Moment.

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:15.055
For a very long time I did not talk about the fact that my father was repressed,

01:55:15.055 --> 01:55:20.062
and only while I got the university, I got the job and I was not mentioning it

01:55:20.062 --> 01:55:25.069
anywhere, or writing it in any documents, but only when rehabilitation began I

01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:29.370
wrote, asking for rehabilitation of my father and I got that paper.

01:55:29.370 --> 01:55:29.370
I understand very well.

01:55:29.370 --> 01:55:29.370
She understands you well, what you

01:55:29.370 --> 01:55:36.110
But he, but he lived in a country which was very anti-Zionist, anti-Semitic, it was the same.

01:55:36.110 --> 01:55:36.350
M-m.

01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:37.730
Did, well, can he talk about that?

01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:45.552
She understands well what you mean, well, you lived in a country that was,

01:55:45.552 --> 01:55:52.530
well, anti-Zionist, anti-Semitic, but how did you experience that?

01:55:52.530 --> 01:56:12.120
I'll tell you, me and my children, I think we didn't feel any oppressions.

01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:15.900
А, I tell you I think that me or my children did not feel

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:19.160
any pressure, did not feel any oppression on that.

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:32.607
I think so, er. True, my eldest son as a doctor, my youngest as an engineer well, er,

01:56:32.607 --> 01:56:46.688
they're very talented, my Vadik, and he as a businessman as well, (he's) very successful,

01:56:46.688 --> 01:57:01.085
right. And he already got us, me and (his) mother right here, in Kiev, in Kiev, completely.

01:57:01.085 --> 01:57:14.533
All okay, we sold our flat in Donetsk and I bought, er, us a flat here. And we're all

01:57:14.533 --> 01:57:25.450
here, in Kiev, well, yes, I don't remember in which year I came here.

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:34.440
So and my both sons are also very talented, the older one is er, a doctor, er, and the younger

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:41.798
one is an engineer, and he is also very talented, er, as an engineer, as a businessman, and

01:57:41.798 --> 01:57:48.510
then he brought me here together with my wife and, and that's how we moved to Kiev.

01:57:49.670 --> 01:57:49.830
Mm.

01:57:49.830 --> 01:58:07.430
Did you keep the contact going with Sasha? And did you meet the others?

01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:20.480
Er, did you maintain some sort of contact with Sasha and did you meet with someone else from, er?

01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:31.880
Constantly, we, met very often, very often. Either at Sasha's, at first, er, he found

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:39.430
me first. But then he found this, er, Semyon Rosenfeld, he found, er, Pechersky]

01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:44.859
and it's true, er, I received a letter from, er, Sasha, that, well, yet another man

01:58:44.859 --> 01:58:50.157
from Sobibor has appeared. True, (he) didn't know that (he was one of) the group,

01:58:50.157 --> 01:58:55.391
well, er, Semyon Rosenfeld. Do you know him? I don't know such a one. And, well,

01:58:55.391 --> 01:58:59.969
later he told that, er, he sort of even participated in this uprising.

01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:01.230
M-m, m-m.

01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:01.480
Well.

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:06.370
So we did keep in touch, first Sasha found me, and then, er

01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:06.370
Semyon.

01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:17.260
er, there was this Semyon Rosenfeld, who found Sasha, and Sasha wrote me, do you know him, because

01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:28.150
he was not from our group, and so Sasha wrote me if I knew him, but I didn't, though it turned out

01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:38.040
that he was there and maybe he also took part in the uprising but we did not meet before.

01:59:38.040 --> 02:00:08.780
I went to visit him, tell him.

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.540
M-m. She's seen Semyon.

02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:25.440
Yes. Well. And then this, er, Wajtsen was found. Well.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:25.440
I-I visited him also.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:25.440
M-m. She's also seen him.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:32.550
Yes. Then there was, er, not Tsyn, Tsybulsky, but that

02:00:33.970 --> 02:00:35.040
Plotnitsky. Plotnitsky.

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:35.720
Oh, oh.

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.020
Plotnitsky, yes, Vadim, Vadim is suggesting.

02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:38.210
Old age.

02:00:38.210 --> 02:00:39.290
Plotnitsky, isn't it?

02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.690
What?

02:00:39.690 --> 02:00:41.200
V-Vadim is suggesting, Plotnitsky.

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.841
Plotnitsky, yes. Plotnitsky. Right, er, this, er, [?Форталераф?] and ? must look

02:00:42.841 --> 02:00:44.520
her Well, in short, we began, I say, like [coughs] every five years, then, I say, they meet.

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.980
Now at Sasha's, now at my place, now at Rosenfeld's, well, and so we would meet.

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:52.330
We started to meet every five years, either at my place or at Sasha's place or at Rozenfeld's place.

02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:04.250
One time, er, one time, er, we were with nine people.

02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:13.930
At some point there were even nine of us. At meetings.

02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:15.830
Er, of these former prisoners.

02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:17.050
The former inmates.

02:01:17.050 --> 02:01:30.003
Well. And then they started to die, one died, another died, and when Sasha had died already,

02:01:30.003 --> 02:01:42.675
then, er, we would already meet rarely. We also met two times in, er, Israel. My sons were

02:01:42.675 --> 02:01:54.080
already organizers of that happening. We travelled with our sons to, er, Sobibor.

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:54.520
very softly [?]

02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:03.210
Er, well, in short, we looked at this, er, there, how it's called, er, well, how

02:02:03.210 --> 02:02:04.800
She knows, she's also been (there).

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.710
Yes, we looked at these, er

02:02:07.710 --> 02:02:08.400
Museum.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:17.121
So we started to meet every five years but then people started to die because of age and then when Sasha

02:02:17.121 --> 02:02:25.592
died we almost did not meet but then twice we've met in Israel and already my sons were organizers of

02:02:25.592 --> 02:02:33.139
that meeting, and once, when we went to Sobibor, and met in that museum to see the museum.

02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:39.230
Yes, I hope he will come at the birthday of Simkha, Simkha will be one hundred.

02:02:39.230 --> 02:02:39.230
O.

02:02:39.230 --> 02:02:39.660
We hope that you will celebrate Simkha's birthday, he'll be hundred this year.

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:39.660
Er, wh(at)?

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:40.160
To Simkha.

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:40.570
Aaa, yes.

02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:41.660
I have promised to come.

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:48.270
[laughs] She promised to come to him for his birthday [laughs].

02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:49.680
We should celebrate

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.480
Perhaps.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:56.350
if somebody gets that age.

02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:59.500
(We) must, must celebrate a hundred years.

02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:07.090
My eldest son has quite a lot of pictures of our meetings.

02:03:07.090 --> 02:03:12.850
My elder son has many pictures of our meetings.

02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:15.110
Yes.

02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:15.110
[?]

02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:21.087
If you'll ask him to bring them and you'll look at these pictures,

02:03:21.087 --> 02:03:26.250
let's say, which of them you would be interested to copy?

02:03:26.250 --> 02:03:31.940
You can ask him to, to see the pictures and maybe to copy some of them if you need.

02:03:32.610 --> 02:03:38.710
Yes. Er, I have promised not to stay too long, so, er, there's some

02:03:38.710 --> 02:03:44.720
questions I still would like to ask but I have to keep my promise.

02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:49.471
Er, we promised that we won't weary you very long today, of course there still

02:03:49.471 --> 02:03:53.980
are some questions, but nevertheless we don't want you to get tired if us.

02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:53.980
Why

02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:53.980
Well, no problem.

02:03:53.980 --> 02:04:02.470
why has he never told the story of his father before, because it's nothing to be ashamed of?

02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:03.910
Before when?

02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:05.300
Before now, clearly.

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:09.390
M-m. But why, well, didn't you talk up to now about the story with your father?

02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:21.200
I didn't want this, didn't want this, this (is) completely different, er, this here

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:31.730
is not related to Sobibor, I just didn't want, er, to touch on this issue.

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:36.323
I just didn't want to touch this question, it's nothing

02:04:36.323 --> 02:04:40.500
to do with Sobibor, so I did not want to touch it.

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:40.500
But it's your story.

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:48.686
This is how it turns out. Er, there are many, many, er, (who) want to show off

02:04:48.686 --> 02:04:56.873
how they suffered from Soviet power, well, er and, therefore I didn't like to,

02:04:56.873 --> 02:05:04.010
er, show myself, that I, er, suffered heavily from Soviet power, er?

02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.160
M-mm.

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:07.710
Isn't it that way? I didn't want that.

02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:17.264
Many people are also trying to show how they suffered from the Soviet authorities and

02:05:17.264 --> 02:05:21.830
I did not want to show that I suffered in any way from the Soviet authorities.

02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:26.080
But it's part of the story of Weisspapier.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:32.530
M-m. But this is a very important part of the story of Weisspapier!

02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:32.530
Yes.

02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:32.530
And I'm interested in Weisspapier.

02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:32.770
M-m, and she's very much interested in Weisspapier.

02:05:32.770 --> 02:05:33.160
Yes.

02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:40.382
Er, what does Sobibor mean in your life? sighs What is the lesson

02:05:40.382 --> 02:05:47.160
you learned from it? Is there anything you learned from life?

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:58.338
Er, well, which place does Sobibor take, well, in your life, is there perhaps some kind of lesson that

02:05:58.338 --> 02:06:08.530
you learned from this, some kind of conclusion that you drew for yourself after these events?

02:06:08.530 --> 02:06:09.370
I can't answer this question.

02:06:09.370 --> 02:06:11.120
I cannot answer this question.

02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:15.140
No? It's okay.

02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:31.325
Well, sorry, er, of course, of course this has formed my conscience. It was an offense,

02:06:31.325 --> 02:06:46.580
an offense, that we, we're a talented people, and all of a sudden to organize such

02:06:46.580 --> 02:07:01.835
a machine of destruction, this is, this doesn't sink in, we, what, a conveyor belt

02:07:01.835 --> 02:07:15.229
of destruction! This should, er, should it be like that? What, what for?

02:07:15.230 --> 02:07:15.230
M-m.

02:07:15.230 --> 02:07:16.530
What I still have, of course it's a huge offense.

02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:25.039
Of course, er, it formed my views and it's very painful that, er, we could do that, to

02:07:25.039 --> 02:07:32.750
organize such a machine of killing, and, what for? That's why it's very painful.

02:07:38.190 --> 02:07:38.380
I understand.

02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:38.730
She understands you.

02:07:38.730 --> 02:07:43.748
I understand. Is there anything you would like to add? I am here

02:07:43.748 --> 02:07:48.140
because of the trial of Demjanjuk, maybe you want to say

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:48.140
M-m.

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:55.870
something about that or maybe you want to add something.

02:07:55.870 --> 02:08:00.320
Er, perhaps you would like to add something yet, in principle she's here also be, because

02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:04.620
of the Demjanjuk trial, perhaps you want to say something about this, but perhaps also

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:04.620
Say, everything.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:04.620
something about something else.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:04.830
I've said, say, everything.

02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:08.350
It seems, it seems.

02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:11.370
What I had to and what I didn't have to tell.

02:08:11.370 --> 02:08:12.420
What I had to and what I didn't have to [laughs].

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:12.420
[laughs].

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:12.420
Thank you very much.

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:14.360
Thank you very much.

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:15.800
Thank you.
