WEBVTT

00:10.720 --> 00:10.720
It's on?

00:10.720 --> 00:10.720
Yes.

00:10.720 --> 00:20.440
My name is Regina Zielinski  I was born in Poland. My maiden name was Feldman and I was born  in 1925.

00:20.440 --> 00:30.161
I don't actually know where to begin, but the day, the month December is a very, very sad month for

00:30.161 --> 00:39.882
me, because the 20th of December we were taking  from our slave labor camp Staw to a place we didn't

00:39.882 --> 00:49.413
even know where we were going, but when we arrived it was Sobibor. And nobody knew about Sobibor. We

00:49.413 --> 00:59.038
never knew about Sobibor, the whole transport was on a horse driven wagon, it was about seven hundred

00:59.038 --> 01:08.854
people of us from the slave labor camp. And when we arrived in Sobibor it was almost, it was not almost

01:08.854 --> 01:18.766
night time, because the days also showed in winter time in Europe and eh the camp was lit like day light

01:18.766 --> 01:28.678
and a lot ofloud speakers eh, eh were playing and when we arrived we all had to get off, out the wagons.

01:28.678 --> 01:38.589
They segregated the men and they did the sons,  and they did separate and the woman and their daughters,

01:38.589 --> 01:48.405
it was separate and then there was a podium there and a very tall SS man was standing on the podium and

01:48.405 --> 01:57.936
he ask who can knit. And my mother pushed me out and she said 'you are a good knitter, step out'

01:57.936 --> 02:07.466
and if you, there was about twelve of us, or thirteen of us, who stepped out that we can knit. And I

02:07.466 --> 02:17.092
said to my sister 'how about you'? She said 'I'll stay with mum, because we might be assigned

02:17.092 --> 02:26.908
to different work'. And they took us away to a very, very big barrack and there was only eh, eh walls

02:26.908 --> 02:36.438
and a roof, they gave us a couple of blankets and, but you know December is the middle of winter, it

02:36.438 --> 02:46.731
was very, very, very cold and we were huddling all together, all night, we heard a lot of machinery running,

02:46.731 --> 02:56.642
but we didn't know what it was and in the morning they came in, a couple of SS men came in, or guards,

02:56.642 --> 03:06.554
we don't know, but they were Germans and they took us out from that barrack to take us somewhere else,

03:06.554 --> 03:16.465
because they came over with men and working gear and all that they were going to build the bara, barrack

03:16.465 --> 03:26.186
up, so half of us they were sit here, banks made where we can sleep. And the other half is going to be

03:26.186 --> 03:36.193
a knitting room. And the knitting room, later on you know they build it all up, but while they were doing

03:36.193 --> 03:45.819
that, another German took us away to a very big barrack. And that barrack had mountains of shoes  and

03:45.819 --> 03:55.444
there was on a c, not quite on a corner a small, small heap of shoes and that eh German guard [clears

03:55.444 --> 04:05.070
throat], excuse me, picked up shoes and for so, he wanted to show us how, how they, good they are. He

04:05.070 --> 04:14.886
said your shoes are might be dirty or worn out and they was handing and the guard shows all of us pairs

04:14.886 --> 04:24.417
tight together and when he gave me a pair of boots and he said 'they might fit you.  My dear, that

04:24.417 --> 04:34.614
was my sister's boots!  Then I knew what Sobibor was. Because while we were on the way coming to Sobibor,

04:34.614 --> 04:44.144
my youngest brother was still on the wagon with mum, my sister and a lot of other women, there was a

04:44.144 --> 04:53.675
crossroad, one was going to Chelm and the other one was going to Wlodawa and when we turned to left,

04:53.675 --> 05:03.491
to Wlodawa, it might be a half an hour later we driving through very big forests, on the each side that

05:03.491 --> 05:12.640
the the German were on, on eh, eh riding on the horses and watching us that nobody will escape.-

05:12.450 --> 05:20.748
And a couple of young people escaped, they stopped the transport, they went into the forest, they

05:20.748 --> 05:29.560
shot them and brought them back and they told us that will happen to, for everybody who wants to escape

05:29.560 --> 05:38.030
and  on the way when we turned, I must go back to tell you what my brother said when he was sitting

05:38.030 --> 05:46.671
with us. Normally the men, elder, elder, he was only eleven years old, but he survived the, the slave

05:46.671 --> 05:55.398
labor camp in Staw and he said to us, he said actually to my mother, mum, he said, let's say goodbye

05:55.398 --> 06:03.868
to the night, because we won't see the daylight. Where that boy heard something in the camp, what

06:03.868 --> 06:12.166
Sobibor was, he never explained, we never knew, because he was hiding in Sobibor, because quite a

06:12.166 --> 06:20.807
few times they were taking out the children you know who is sick and took them away. And one day when

06:20.807 --> 06:29.192
we were even walk, going to work there were trenches open and later on we heard a lot of shooting,

06:29.192 --> 06:37.832
a lot of people got shot and there was one ye, a boy, he was seven years old, with his mother in the,

06:37.832 --> 06:46.217
in, in, in the camp and he, they were from Lublin from, from another city, and he, her husband was

06:46.217 --> 06:54.772
a, a Polish soldier, a Jewish Polish soldier and I don't know if he survived or not, but when they

06:54.772 --> 07:03.499
took out all the children and other sick people, that little boy, later on the Polish people witnessed

07:03.499 --> 07:11.883
that,  said to the Germans because he could speak, not from Lublin, from Polsenheim he could speak

07:11.883 --> 07:20.267
German, and he was supposed to say to the Germans if you want to shoot us, I want to be the first.

07:20.267 --> 07:28.737
Later on they will told us and the mother find out when we came back from work, that the beautiful

07:28.737 --> 07:37.121
boy was not there anymore.  And I don't have to tell you much what happened to people like that.

07:37.121 --> 07:45.762
And then we realised, later on I realised what my mother, brother Paul said to us let's say goodbye

07:45.762 --> 07:54.061
to the night, because we will never see all the persons, the whole of my family, left alive. When

07:54.061 --> 08:02.360
I was handed over my sister's boots I knew that Sobibor was not a normal concentration camp, it

08:02.360 --> 08:11.086
was a death camp.  And the 20th of December 1942 I lost my whole world. I was the only one left alive.

08:11.086 --> 08:19.727
There was somebody with me, a second cousin, she was alive too, Zelda Metz   and that was from, from

08:19.727 --> 08:28.112
the people I knew, the others were from different cities, because that transport was seven hundred

08:28.112 --> 08:29.309
people, of us.

08:29.310 --> 08:31.080
Where did the, Regina, where did this transport come from?

08:31.080 --> 08:39.417
From Staw, it was from Staw, from a slave labor camp. [spells] S T A W, Staw,  there's another

08:39.417 --> 08:47.582
name to it, but it's too long, that was a very big slave labour camp. Because there were all

08:47.582 --> 08:56.354
the, the Jewish people from the ghettos, from all around Siedliczcze from Chelm, you name it, little,

08:56.354 --> 09:04.692
you know, places around a bigger city, there was allover is farmers and all that, all the Jewish

09:04.692 --> 09:13.290
people were gathered in that particular camp. You know. In Staw and all of us, a lot died of hunger

09:13.290 --> 09:21.628
and sickness and stuff. Because there wasn't enough, everything as rationed and it was so cold

09:21.628 --> 09:29.966
and, but people do it first when we were in ghetto at home, we had to dig trenches to straighten

09:29.966 --> 09:38.390
a river. When that was finished we were taken to Staw to do the same thing, to straighten a river

09:38.390 --> 09:46.641
and the winter was coming on, we went to Staw the 22nd of October 1942. We were only two months

09:46.641 --> 09:51.939
there and then the 20th of December we were taken to Sobibor.

09:51.940 --> 09:55.010
Regina, when you talk about your family

09:55.010 --> 09:55.870
Yes?

09:56.060 --> 09:58.240
how large was your family?

09:58.240 --> 10:04.391
My family, I had, my brother died before then and I had, that's another story how

10:04.391 --> 10:10.542
my b, eldest brother died. It was when the Germans came into Siedliczcze they, they

10:10.542 --> 10:15.730
took a lot of things away and then they burned eh first of all ghetto.

10:15.730 --> 10:22.170
All the Jews one day, that was the 18th of May 1942 or '41, doesn't matter. We were

10:22.170 --> 10:22.170
'41.

10:22.170 --> 10:32.010
we, we went to work and when we were coming back from work the 18th of May, '41 I think

10:32.010 --> 10:34.250
Yes.

10:35.220 --> 10:42.874
and we were not allowed to go back home anymore. It was a beautiful day, so nice and warm because May

10:42.874 --> 10:50.907
is spring and what we had owned for work, that's what we were left on, and that when they, they cornered

10:50.907 --> 10:58.486
off a few streets and we were going to, to stay in the ghetto, we were not allowed home anymore. And

10:58.486 --> 11:06.065
from that ghetto we were taking to Staw and that was a slave labour camp. There was already a lot of

11:06.065 --> 11:13.643
people missing, whatever, you know that, that the thing was rationed, there is a lot, a lot of other

11:13.643 --> 11:20.010
things happening, but it's a little bit, might be too much to drag it on, you know

11:20.010 --> 11:21.290
No, it's not.

11:21.290 --> 11:29.363
when, when we were in ghetto we had to, to go; our house was taken over like from, in  German, were

11:29.363 --> 11:37.763
the Wasserwirtschaftsamt, that was we were working for to straighten the rivers and our house was taken

11:37.763 --> 11:45.755
over by the engineer and two girls. One was Irene and the other Myszka, they were the secretaries,

11:45.755 --> 11:54.073
the Wasserwirtschaftsambt and the eh, engineer was Kiendracki. And he was such a lovely man, he wanted

11:54.073 --> 12:02.147
to help that many people and because people get assigned in the ghetto close to our hou, not house,

12:02.147 --> 12:10.302
but we had a very big property and eh building material property and about a, an acre of garden like

12:10.302 --> 12:18.457
eh fruit trees and other things was growing in there, in that little cottage where a engineer lived,

12:18.457 --> 12:26.857
we were assigned for seven people a cottage in the ghetto. And because it was so close to our property,

12:26.857 --> 12:35.094
the, the  engineer has said you can go in  but make it so that nobody will look eh, like, like a hole

12:35.094 --> 12:43.576
in the fence in, go through to your garden and pick whatever it's ripe there, even fruit or vegetable,

12:43.576 --> 12:52.138
but it was still growing and you take it and that will help you a lot to share with other people. Because

12:52.138 --> 13:00.212
nobody is going to pick it from that garden, they didn't need it. That what I mean that he was so

13:00.212 --> 13:08.367
good. In another time he came over to my other sister and myself and my mother, he said that the two

13:08.367 --> 13:16.359
ladies, the secretaries would like somebody to come and clean their place. And that was our house,

13:16.359 --> 13:24.678
he only meant it that way that we can take a little bit clothes out of the cupboards. So we went there

13:24.678 --> 13:33.159
to clean and every day we put on different things, so we had something in the ghetto to change ourselves

13:33.159 --> 13:41.314
and warm, because winter was coming, warm clothes too and he was such the perfect angel for us that,

13:41.314 --> 13:49.388
that engineer, you know? He was good for everybody else, you know, to, to work out for the woman to

13:49.388 --> 13:57.380
have lighter work, where there were send the soil to dig you know, sometimes he was standing knee,

13:57.380 --> 14:05.454
knee deep in water to straighten the rivers, I told you not, and he, we managed to do it and it was

14:05.454 --> 14:07.329
we managed to survive.

14:07.330 --> 14:12.613
Can you talk a little bit about the house? Because I know

14:12.613 --> 14:16.970
when you were talking about it now, you see it.

14:16.970 --> 14:16.970
I see it.

14:16.970 --> 14:16.970
And I, I don't

14:16.970 --> 14:16.970
It was

14:16.970 --> 14:17.660
know the house.

14:17.660 --> 14:26.427
it was a very big, like a ranch house and that was divided in half because my grandmother and greatgrandmother

14:26.427 --> 14:34.476
had eh one half and we had the other half. And because there was five of us, I had three brothers and

14:34.476 --> 14:42.606
one sister, and the grandmother and greatgrandmother gave up a quarter of their place, so we will have

14:42.606 --> 14:50.576
bigger rooms, for five of us. And that was, the property was about an acre, it was building material

14:50.576 --> 14:58.466
property. We needed a lot of room. And when the property was not finished, but on the end there was

14:58.466 --> 15:06.436
a brook, and, and that was the end of our property. There was a very big, might be an acre, might be

15:06.436 --> 15:14.247
more, we had a garden, fruit trees and vegetable garden and shrubs and all that. So we were a lot,

15:14.247 --> 15:22.137
a lot self sufficient in the summer. Because we were growing everything and we had even a horse and

15:22.137 --> 15:30.107
we had a cow and we had a lot of different, you know, chicken and geeses and, and, and ducks and you

15:30.107 --> 15:34.730
name it. We had everything there. The property was so big.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.880
What did you do?

15:36.880 --> 15:42.951
My hou, my father was helping people like to build the, the farmers houses,

15:42.951 --> 15:49.346
of farmers eh, eh what is it called to whatever keeping the hay and straw, what

15:49.346 --> 15:54.770
is it called, the big, big eh, help me out with that word, I forgot

15:54.770 --> 15:55.740
I don't know which word you are looking for.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.900
At, anyhow eh, sh, not shacks, what do farmers have

16:01.900 --> 16:05.850
where they keep the, the, the winter stuff in it?

16:05.850 --> 16:05.850
Staples?

16:05.850 --> 16:13.936
It, it will come to me and it, it's not so important. And he was helping a lot of eh, in the, in the

16:13.936 --> 16:22.023
to build houses up for the farmers and every Thursday there was the weekly eh market day and a lot of

16:22.023 --> 16:30.269
people were coming over with their produce and a lot of eh, eh cabinet makers and, and other people were

16:30.269 --> 16:38.276
coming over for timber, for make doors and windows and, and garages and all that. They were coming on

16:38.276 --> 16:46.363
Thursday, they were coming to buy that what my parents had for sale. And that, but needed a lot, a lot

16:46.363 --> 16:54.688
of room, because that timber there, everything had to be on the roofs, it was all covered so it wasn't,

16:54.688 --> 17:02.616
timber that was coming straight from the saw mills. That was coming into our place, because the saw

17:02.616 --> 17:10.624
mills were not far away. Father used to go there and order it and then, and the farmers used to bring

17:10.624 --> 17:18.790
over the, the timber. And that was for the work, you know, the ones who, who, who, you know, the market

17:18.790 --> 17:26.956
was always full with  not just eh what they were making, but, but just, you know, cows and other things

17:26.956 --> 17:32.110
and live stock and all that, every Thursday there was market day.

17:32.110 --> 17:38.560
But you were fifteen when you went, send to the ghetto. What was

17:38.560 --> 17:38.820
Yes.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.590
your, what were your daily chores, what were your doing?

17:41.590 --> 17:42.900
In the ghetto?

17:42.900 --> 17:45.200
No, before, at the house.

17:45.200 --> 17:52.902
Before I was still at school. The war broke out when I was fourteen and I didn't, the Germans when

17:52.902 --> 18:00.912
they came in they saw the Jewish people were not to go back to school, because the schoolyear in Europe,

18:00.912 --> 18:08.768
you know it too, that starts in September. In September the war started, the Jewish people, the pupils

18:08.768 --> 18:16.547
will have dif, special schools, we never go to special school, we had to register ourselves for work,

18:16.547 --> 18:24.249
from fifteen years old. So mum makes us all a year older, so that I was fourteen but she made it out

18:24.249 --> 18:31.874
that I was fifteen, so my sister was a year older and the eldest brother, so we all can fit in, the

18:31.874 --> 18:39.576
brother after me could fit in for work too, only the youngest couldn't, he was too young then. And

18:39.576 --> 18:47.278
then we were all going out to work from home to straighten the rivers. You know the Mogilanka river,

18:47.278 --> 18:51.900
yes. And when that finished, it was the ghetto. Instead from

18:51.900 --> 18:57.320
Do you mind me to come back on my question?

18:57.320 --> 18:57.840
Yes?

18:57.840 --> 18:58.500
I want you to talk about the old house.

18:58.500 --> 18:58.500
Oh, the house.

18:58.500 --> 19:06.330
And what you did the full day, because you didn't go to school many years.

19:06.330 --> 19:11.680
Man, man, not many years. No, it wasn't many years. It was only one year when we

19:11.680 --> 19:14.620
Did you work on the land or eh

19:14.620 --> 19:15.130
No, I

19:15.130 --> 19:16.190
did you take care of the ducks

19:16.190 --> 19:23.423
you know, we helped out at home and eh  there was always something to do, then we had to eh arrange

19:23.423 --> 19:31.094
for teachers, there was a teacher who was teaching us at home and the boys were being tought by somebody,

19:31.094 --> 19:38.328
you know, like a cheider, we couldn't go anymore to school or then, there always, you know, there

19:38.328 --> 19:45.415
was something to do before you know, the ghetto and we have to give up a lot of things we have to

19:45.415 --> 19:52.721
get, gave up, later on we had to stand in a queue with a bucket of timber or coal to that, you know,

19:52.721 --> 20:00.100
to get, because everything was rationed. What did we do at home I can't tell you what we were doing

20:00.100 --> 20:07.261
at home when the war broke out. There were that many different things, we had a lot of people from

20:07.261 --> 20:14.494
western Poland that was escaping from the front who were coming.We heard from, from a lot, a lot of

20:14.494 --> 20:21.581
big cities, you know, they were from  and would  go but to the, to the east to get away and a lot

20:21.581 --> 20:29.033
was escaping to, to, to Russia and then, and the war broke out, you know, with the Germans and Russia,

20:29.033 --> 20:32.760
that, that was like a volcano that place, you know?

20:33.580 --> 20:37.810
But do you mind to come back to your house before the war?

20:37.810 --> 20:39.200
Before the war?

20:39.200 --> 20:39.870
Yes.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.000
I was at school.

20:41.360 --> 20:41.550
Yes?

20:41.550 --> 20:49.108
Yes. And my sister, my brother was at high school, he was learning, my sister was one

20:49.108 --> 20:57.022
year in Warsaw at the high school, you know, she was learning kiput , what was it called,

20:57.022 --> 21:03.779
eh  eh, handel, handelschule, handelschule, how would that be in English, eh

21:03.790 --> 21:05.180
A commercial schule

21:05.180 --> 21:12.058
Commercial yes, yes, commercial. And my brother was in a different commercial thing, but he was next

21:12.058 --> 21:18.868
in Chelm, but my sister went to Warsaw and just when the war broke out she was only one year there.

21:18.868 --> 21:25.747
How she got back from Warsaw when the war was raging, I don't know. You know. What we did, before,

21:25.747 --> 21:32.626
we were all young children, you know? We were helping out what we could at home, grandmother told us

21:32.626 --> 21:39.368
to cook and to, and to clean and all that and, and you know, she was always there to help and, and

21:39.368 --> 21:46.178
greatgrandmother told us how to knit and, and, and you know, and how to, my sister was a, an artist

21:46.178 --> 21:51.749
of the broidery, she didn't like knitting, so I will, I was the knitter and she

21:51.750 --> 21:51.750
slSL You were?

21:51.750 --> 21:56.472
Sp I will do something else, you know? And that, for I was doing the

21:56.472 --> 22:01.681
knitting in the camp in Sobibor, you know? You know, that was eh, I don't

22:01.681 --> 22:05.710
know, saved my life, the knitting, I don't know. Anyhow.

22:05.710 --> 22:11.100
Was it a religious family?

22:11.100 --> 22:11.100
I beg you pardon?

22:11.100 --> 22:11.530
Was it a religious family?

22:11.530 --> 22:19.487
Oh, we were not fanatics. It was a little bit like liberal. But we were observing very much all the

22:19.487 --> 22:27.445
holidays. We girls ne, never were tought anything like the boys ant cheider but one year before the

22:27.445 --> 22:35.322
war, we managed a lady, she was a widow and very fair, you know, she had enough to hire a teacher,

22:35.322 --> 22:43.280
and she gave half her house up to teach the girls eh Hebrew and, and the other things and other, so

22:43.280 --> 22:51.720
one year only I had to, to learn a little bit more than tradition, because at home, what we were learning

22:51.720 --> 22:59.839
about Jew, Jewish it was only tradition, what it meant, that holiday what it meant or something else,

22:59.839 --> 23:07.957
and twice a year we used to go with mum to the synagogue. That was only at Pesach and eh  three times

23:07.957 --> 23:15.835
a year, Rosj Hasjana and Jom Kippur, there was the girls never went to, to Sjoel from long and all

23:15.835 --> 23:23.632
that. And that's what we learned a year before the war and eh, and didn't know much. Later on

23:23.632 --> 23:31.589
you know it's so easy to forget the Hebrew. I still know the, the eh alphabet in Hebrew, that's

23:31.589 --> 23:39.627
what I eh I remember, that was all. But later on, in Australia I learned a little bit more about it.

23:39.627 --> 23:47.746
Where I lived in Sidney the synagogue was teaching us. And eh  I don't know how to explain  we were

23:47.746 --> 23:55.704
very traditional, you know, with everything because grandmother and greatgrandmother was there too.

23:55.704 --> 24:03.661
And they were, I don't know how to say, because eh we used to go to the synagogue, they had their

24:03.661 --> 24:11.458
places, their chairs in the, when the big synagogue was build, later on the Germans burnt it down

24:11.458 --> 24:19.416
and that's where mein, eldest brother was sitting all day, that was in September, and eh cleaning

24:19.416 --> 24:27.374
the, the bricks of the synagogue, that was a day before the 11th of September, before the Jewish'

24:27.374 --> 24:35.894
newyear and after the day was over, he came home and he felt not good. He said he doesn't want anything,

24:35.894 --> 24:44.093
he just wanted to lie down and he laid down in bed and by the time the evening came, there was curfew,

24:44.093 --> 24:52.051
we couldn't go out bef, after eight o'clock at night, we have to wait for the boy to come about

24:52.051 --> 24:59.928
and then when they come and they didn't come and my brother needed a doctor. We had doctors, but

24:59.928 --> 25:07.886
we couldn't go out to call them. And by the time the doctor, six o'clock in the morning, it was

25:07.886 --> 25:08.609
too late.

25:08.610 --> 25:18.869
He died of a m, massive hart attack.  And he was only twenty two years old.  And I remember the,

25:18.869 --> 25:29.128
the minute when he passed away. He was on, lying on the bed  and my mum correct a little bit his

25:29.128 --> 25:40.243
pillow and I was standing on the foot of his bed and eh  and I ask him would he like me to do something.

25:40.243 --> 25:50.288
But I could hear that he hit with his feet, he hit the bed and that was his last  breath. So I

25:50.288 --> 26:00.548
was witnessing my brother's passing.  That was the 11th of September 1942. It was the  of Rosj

26:00.548 --> 26:10.593
Hasjana. And then he still had, my mum used to help us out a little bit, because my sister was

26:10.593 --> 26:20.639
very close, I was close with him too, because he was the eldest and she was very sick, and mum

26:20.639 --> 26:30.685
said he is going to heaven and no more Jewish burial but we don't know where we will end up.

26:30.685 --> 26:40.730
He still had, you know, because his still was buried on the Jewish cemetary. Later on we found

26:40.730 --> 26:50.883
out, we saw it anyhow, that the Germans took out all the headstones, turned them upsidedown and

26:50.883 --> 27:00.929
they made footpaths out of them.  So that was the, the history what the Germans did  I can't

27:00.929 --> 27:11.188
explain anything else anymore, because that was the grave of the whole family of, of everything,

27:11.188 --> 27:17.280
for everyone and I was left alone.  That's what I know.

27:17.280 --> 27:25.140
Did you, Regina, did you ever expect the war to come to  Siedliczcze?

27:25.140 --> 27:26.970
Did I

27:26.970 --> 27:28.880
Did you expect the war to come, did your family talk about a threat?

27:28.880 --> 27:37.250
Oh, we, we heard, we heard that, you know, that a lot of people were escaping from Czechoslovakia,

27:37.250 --> 27:45.705
from Austria, we had them all in Poland because the, eh, annexation in 1938, Austria was, you know,

27:45.705 --> 27:54.331
to, to Germany and they didn't like the Jews. And the one people who in Austria or German who where

27:54.331 --> 28:03.128
be poor and born in Poland, but they lived for that long in the country, they were send back to Poland,

28:03.128 --> 28:11.584
because they were Jewish and we had to put them all up, you know, and all that we heard about what,

28:11.584 --> 28:19.954
what is happening in the north, what they are doing and eh  you see, my father registered us to go

28:19.954 --> 28:29.007
to, to Palestine in 1937. We were going to migrate from Poland, but there was a quote to get to Palestine.

28:29.007 --> 28:37.377
The English had a quote to let in from Poland that many Jews a year. And we were too far away from

28:37.377 --> 28:45.576
the quote, we never managed to get there. Because the war broke out two years after. So that's

28:45.576 --> 28:54.117
the history how we liked, would have loved to be somewhere, maybe would have, but that was not meant

28:54.117 --> 29:02.914
to. But the only thing I remember, and I'll never forget, Pechersky. He helped a lot with the escape.

29:02.914 --> 29:11.113
I don't know if you've, the date when they brought in the Russian prisoners of war, that was

29:11.113 --> 29:13.419
the 23rd of September 1943.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.600
But Regina

29:14.750 --> 29:14.890
Yes?

29:14.890 --> 29:18.160
you're going so fast, so maybe I may slow you down?

29:18.160 --> 29:18.350
Yes.

29:18.350 --> 29:23.090
Eh  because we have enough time to talk about all

29:23.090 --> 29:23.870
Talk about, yes.

29:23.870 --> 29:25.750
yes and don't feel hurried please.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.070
No, I won't.

29:28.070 --> 29:31.140
Before the Germans came, I assume the Russians came?

29:31.510 --> 29:39.267
Oh, the Russians were one week only.  I forgot, forgot about it. When the Polish

29:39.267 --> 29:47.122
army was gathering  all across Poland to the very big river Bug because they were

29:47.122 --> 29:55.073
going to assemble a front for the Germans on the other side of the river, and when

29:55.073 --> 30:01.280
German and the Russian signed the eh  what is it called Northern

30:01.280 --> 30:01.950
Non agression Agreement

30:01.950 --> 30:11.238
The non agression with the, with the Russians and when the Polish army got through the water, they took

30:11.238 --> 30:20.437
the army, the Russian, the communist, took the army away, all the, the officers were taken separate to

30:20.437 --> 30:29.456
an ordinary soldier. And the officer were taking to a forest who was called Katyn  forest, you know,

30:29.456 --> 30:38.474
where twelve thousand officers were shot there and buried in the forest. We found that out after the

30:38.474 --> 30:47.583
war. Every officer had one bullet of the back of, of his head and the hands were tight up in the back

30:47.583 --> 30:57.052
and they were in the Katyn forest. And the ordinary soldier was taken to Siberia.  And my future husband,

30:57.052 --> 31:06.161
he was an officer but he was wounded on the Rumanian border and because of his wounds he was stripped

31:06.161 --> 31:15.540
from his uniform, because others wanted it, the, the boots and all that and that saved his life, because

31:15.540 --> 31:24.739
he didn't go with the officers, he was an ordinary soldier and he was taken  to, to Siberia. I later

31:24.739 --> 31:33.847
on, when I met him, and he, and later on the Germans when they declared war on Russia, and because he

31:33.847 --> 31:42.866
was born, he was born in Aus, in eh,  south Prussia, that was once, have you  heard of Danzig , that

31:42.866 --> 31:52.155
big, big city, the free city that was in Pruissian, he was born not far there and they thought, because

31:52.155 --> 32:01.263
he was from there, he might sign the papers as a, as a German, because his father was in the Bismarck

32:01.263 --> 32:10.733
army before Hitler came along and they thought that he will sign, so they got all the Polish  eh prisoner

32:10.733 --> 32:19.932
of war from Russia, they got them all out, but he didn't signed with the Germans, he was in a Polish

32:19.932 --> 32:29.221
prisoner of war in Germany, not far from Frankfurt.  And later on I found that out, later on when I was

32:29.221 --> 32:33.550
in Frankfurt, that's where I met him. Yes. Now

32:34.070 --> 32:36.580
No, I  you're going so fast again.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.870
So fast. Hm.

32:37.870 --> 32:40.920
How long was your husband in Siberia?

32:42.350 --> 32:48.513
I don't know when, when they took him out, I don't know how long he was, because

32:48.513 --> 32:54.897
it was so and the German took all the others out, with somebody with a general Sikorsky

32:54.897 --> 33:00.694
took all the, the Polish prisoners from Russian out, I don't know much about

33:00.694 --> 33:05.170
it, how long he was. But how he survived is almost a miracle.

33:05.170 --> 33:08.340
But for a week the Russians where in Siedliczcze

33:08.340 --> 33:08.610
Yes.

33:08.610 --> 33:11.080
have you seen them?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.560
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, we had before

33:12.560 --> 33:15.430
Can you tell me how you first met the Russian army?

33:15.430 --> 33:24.709
Russian army, that was, the Jewish newyear, Rosj Hasjana, and they first came in because we've had

33:24.709 --> 33:33.340
the big property, so the cav, cavalery, you know, not the, the  the one on foot, the soldiers

33:33.340 --> 33:33.340
Infantry.

33:33.340 --> 33:41.833
infantry, and then they, the one on the horses, so the horses was stationed at our place. And

33:41.833 --> 33:49.870
a lot of the Polish army came in and eh there were going to, to cross the, the, the, the

33:49.870 --> 33:49.980
The Bug

33:49.980 --> 33:57.840
the, the Bug river and I remember there was somebody from eh, eh  northern, northern Poland where

33:57.840 --> 34:05.863
my grandmother had eh relatives there and there was a Polish officer, but Jewish Polish officer and

34:05.863 --> 34:13.805
he, my grandmother called out, maybe somebody [...] the officer will be somebody from there and he

34:13.805 --> 34:21.989
was there and some other officers and they stationed there for one night, because there were all that

34:21.989 --> 34:30.012
many coming and coming, the infantry and I remember one officer ask my mother what would you rather

34:30.012 --> 34:38.278
have, the Germans or the Russian? And I still can hear her wo, words, she said, well how can you chose

34:38.278 --> 34:46.706
from two deadly diseases?  That was her answer. And then they were, they crossed the Bug and the Russian

34:46.706 --> 34:54.810
took the army away. The Polish army.  I think I said that before. Before that what they did to them.

34:54.810 --> 35:03.076
But I don't know how long that eh, later on when he became my husband I've found he was in Germany

35:03.076 --> 35:07.290
as a prisoner, Polish prisoner of war. In Frankfurt.

35:07.290 --> 35:09.390
But my question was

35:09.790 --> 35:10.670
Yes?

35:11.260 --> 35:15.210
Regina,  how did you see, what was the first Russian you met? They came to Siedliczcze.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.850
Yes, they came in, they looked

35:16.850 --> 35:17.980
How did you know?

35:19.520 --> 35:25.093
that they looked in and we had white bread to - on the table, you know

35:25.093 --> 35:30.110
how Rosj Hasjana, how we had celebrating the, the, the holiday.

35:30.110 --> 35:33.180
So you were sitting at the Rosj Hasjana table?

35:33.180 --> 35:40.300
table when they came in and they looked in, we had that particular door, had, the half of it was glass,

35:40.300 --> 35:47.214
they looked in and we opened up some, I don't know who got up from the table to open the door, and

35:47.214 --> 35:54.404
some of them come in and then mein parents understood Russian because they were from the First Worldwar,

35:54.404 --> 36:01.525
the Russians was there, so they learned Russia and, and eh he looked at the white bread of the challah,

36:01.525 --> 36:08.923
and he ask us, I still remember those words, because we understood a little bit of Russia, we were supposed

36:08.923 --> 36:13.970
not to, and he said [says something in Russian], that means what is that?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.220
He didn't know?

36:15.220 --> 36:18.610
They didn't know what Challah was, what white bread was.

36:19.330 --> 36:20.800
And so then

36:20.800 --> 36:28.763
And we explained to it them and all that and the, all they wanted it to get and you know that they, one

36:28.763 --> 36:36.494
even went to a watch maker, he took an alarm clock and because that was big, and he ask him could he

36:36.494 --> 36:44.302
make two wrist watches out of that clock, what they ever could gather eh, eh for valuables they never

36:44.302 --> 36:52.188
ask how much, they just took it and all that and then when the Ru, Germans came along  and the Russian

36:52.188 --> 37:00.151
had to leave  and that  didn't have anybody, we didn't have any, any soldiers from the Russians and

37:00.151 --> 37:08.036
we didn't have any German soldiers, like  hooligans, was to inc, eh, I don't know, there is a word

37:08.036 --> 37:15.845
for it, you know, breaking everything and they had ammunition from the soldiers who were running away

37:15.845 --> 37:23.962
or something, I don't know, shooting, so a delegation went from Siedliczcze to Chelm to ask the Germans

37:23.962 --> 37:29.219
to come in and to straighten everything out a little bit, because we

37:29.220 --> 37:31.660
You mean after the Russian left

37:31.660 --> 37:31.660
The Russian

37:31.660 --> 37:32.710
there was chaos.

37:32.710 --> 37:36.930
Yes. It was nobody there, we didn't have any police, because the Russian

37:36.930 --> 37:37.510
No protection, yes.

37:37.510 --> 37:45.143
no, no protection, the Russian took all the Polish police away and then the Germans send over

37:45.143 --> 37:52.776
from western Poland, police, Polish police. But from western Poland, because Russian didn't

37:52.776 --> 38:00.737
give the, the people  up once they took, and a lot of the people who were a little bit, you know,

38:00.737 --> 38:07.550
a little bit more, how, how, had the shops and had the little bit, not just or, all

38:07.550 --> 38:08.160
Middle class, yes.

38:08.160 --> 38:14.108
yes, not ordinary workers, because he was looking in the people's hands and

38:14.108 --> 38:19.670
if, if they didn't have callousis that meant that they were Russia, eh

38:19.670 --> 38:20.500
very, very rich.

38:20.500 --> 38:20.750
Yes.

38:20.750 --> 38:27.435
You know, so they don't deserve much, because that, all that, they were taken away and even they took

38:27.435 --> 38:33.926
the priest away and there was a deacan and they took a lot of prominent people from Siedliczcze away

38:33.926 --> 38:40.612
and all that and then, then, when the Germans came, they did the same, took a lot prominent people, the

38:40.612 --> 38:47.232
school teachers away and they will be send back, if nothing happened to a German soldier or something,

38:47.232 --> 38:52.879
I never know if they ever got back or not, because we were not there anymore. You know.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.340
Were you scared of the Russians?

38:56.340 --> 39:04.911
No, we were not scared, but they, they didn't treat us normal, like, like, like eh, eh, it might

39:04.911 --> 39:13.396
the hierarchy was a little bit better educated, but the ordinary soldier, they, they, some of the

39:13.396 --> 39:21.705
soldiers had only a hole in a blanket and a rope tied around to the waist and a rifle, that was

39:21.705 --> 39:30.627
all that the infantry, they were not even dressed properly as soldiers. Only the hierarchy was dressed

39:30.627 --> 39:37.450
alright, you know. On the horses and all that. You know. But not the infantry.

39:37.450 --> 39:38.870
And the Germans were better organised?

39:38.870 --> 39:46.907
Oh yes, they were to try, they were plundering everything too, whatever they could, but, but it

39:46.907 --> 39:55.199
was different, that, eh  how shall I say, no,  oh, the,  that was put, put, there wasn't anymore

39:55.199 --> 40:03.321
and there was eh beating and shooting and plundering like before, but they did it there own way,

40:03.321 --> 40:11.951
the Germans. Slowly, slowly they did it the same what the Russian did. But they were the, the masters.

40:11.951 --> 40:18.720
We couldn't say no to them, you know. [sighs] It was a time  it wasn't easy.

40:18.720 --> 40:23.940
Yes, very few people who can talk about this, two armies in one

40:23.940 --> 40:24.850
In one place.

40:24.850 --> 40:27.130
Yes. So that's why I'm asking you.

40:27.130 --> 40:27.720
Yes.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.180
You are a witness

40:29.180 --> 40:29.890
Yes, I

40:29.890 --> 40:30.730
of those events.

40:30.730 --> 40:38.850
I was witness to that event, yes, yes, yes, yes. And a lot of the young people from   Siedliczcze probably,

40:38.850 --> 40:45.680
not woman, but most eh young men, boys shall I call them, they went with the Russian army.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.820
They went east?

40:46.820 --> 40:54.977
They were east, yes, because they were hearing that the Germans mostly take the, the, the men

40:54.977 --> 41:03.222
folk away and, and we never saw them again, they did the same thing. The Germans took a lot of

41:03.222 --> 41:11.555
men folk away and then, once a German, that was the first winter, when a German soldier came in

41:11.555 --> 41:19.712
on a motor bike and the, the, the, the  whole around us, everything, you know, was covered in

41:19.712 --> 41:27.870
snow, he couldn't see the road, or, or the, the, the, the gutter, and he got with his motor

41:27.870 --> 41:36.203
bike in a ditch or something and he killed himself and whatever, pardon me, he was killed. They

41:36.203 --> 41:44.536
took a lot of people away and they came in to Siedliczcze and they took all the, the men, first

41:44.536 --> 41:51.290
the Jewish men had to come out, every  tenth man was taken away and executed.

41:51.290 --> 41:58.030
But when you talk about those men who went east, wa, are you talking about the Jewish inhabi, men of

41:58.030 --> 41:58.970
Yes, Jew, Jewish

41:58.970 --> 41:59.500
The Jewish

41:59.500 --> 41:59.750
men.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.370
So there were a lot of Jews who followed the Russians

42:02.370 --> 42:03.750
Followed the Russian, yes, yes.

42:03.750 --> 42:04.940
to go east.

42:04.940 --> 42:11.127
to go east beause that what they, they were telling us, there were no escaped, you know, from

42:11.127 --> 42:17.314
western Poland, from Austria, from Czechoslovakia, when the Germans came in. You know, mostly

42:17.314 --> 42:22.970
they were concentrated what they doing to the men, so they escaped with the Russians.

42:22.970 --> 42:23.840
Hmhm.

42:25.170 --> 42:32.312
Yes, later on we got to know, for, eh, some eh, were somebody who was mein sister's

42:32.312 --> 42:39.454
friend, you know, and he found his father there and eh this father was in Canada and,

42:39.454 --> 42:47.101
and, and they didn't let him out from Russia, from the communist Russia and the Canadian,

42:47.101 --> 42:54.412
or the father wanted to get his son out from the communist, they didn't allow it, but

42:54.412 --> 43:00.210
they allowed the Canadian father to go to Russia to see his son. Yes.

43:00.210 --> 43:05.380
So, the Russians left and a lot of Jewish men left to the east?

43:05.380 --> 43:11.060
Not, not actually Jewish people from families, only younger, single men.

43:11.060 --> 43:12.930
They went with the Russians east?

43:12.930 --> 43:14.230
They went with the Russians, yes.

43:14.230 --> 43:17.960
And they expected to be better there? Or safer?

43:17.960 --> 43:22.263
I, I don't know. That might be, you know, but communist

43:22.263 --> 43:26.190
never let anybody go, so it wasn't easy. You know.

43:26.510 --> 43:32.060
And you, when did you meet for the first time a German in Siedliczcze?

43:32.060 --> 43:32.930
The Germans in Siedliczcze?

43:32.930 --> 43:37.210
Yes, when did you saw the, see the first German?

43:37.210 --> 43:38.030
That was still September.

43:38.120 --> 43:38.970
Yes?

43:38.970 --> 43:45.835
Yes, maybe  I think it could have been maybe that eh, the third week in September. I don't

43:45.835 --> 43:52.850
know, I can't remember. No. I only know when the Russian came in, that was the Rosj Hasjana,

43:52.850 --> 43:58.000
I think it was the 18th of September. I'm not sure, but I think so.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.150
I'm not asking you for data

44:00.150 --> 44:00.680
No.

44:00.680 --> 44:05.800
I'm asking for you, you  when did you've seen the first German soldier, how

44:05.800 --> 44:05.800
In, in

44:05.800 --> 44:05.970
how, how

44:05.970 --> 44:07.430
Sep, September, in September.

44:07.430 --> 44:13.220
but, but hÃ³w did you see him? Eh, was it in a bakery, was it in the garden?

44:13.220 --> 44:15.790
No, they, they just marched in.

44:15.890 --> 44:16.730
They marched in and you

44:16.730 --> 44:16.960
Marched in

44:16.960 --> 44:17.500
were looking?

44:17.500 --> 44:20.000
yes. And we were still at home

44:20.000 --> 44:20.750
Yes?

44:20.750 --> 44:28.086
you know. So they, whatever my mum could speak very well German and my father couldn't,

44:28.086 --> 44:35.588
but my mother could, because when my mother grew up, after First, before the First Worldwar

44:35.588 --> 44:42.925
in, in Russia, she could speak French and German and Russian. She learned Polish from the

44:42.925 --> 44:49.850
French alphabet, because the Germans had the Gothic and the Russian had the Cyrillic

44:49.850 --> 44:50.500
Yes.

44:50.500 --> 44:55.380
yes, but she learned Polish from the French alphabet.

44:55.480 --> 44:56.180
Uhuh.

44:56.180 --> 45:02.540
After the First Worldwar, so she could fluent three languages and Jiddisch [laughs].

45:02.540 --> 45:03.380
Not to forget.

45:03.380 --> 45:07.280
Yes, never forget it. Yes.

45:07.280 --> 45:13.066
Jiddisch, that's also a language. Eh [scrapes throat], your family, eh, can you

45:13.066 --> 45:18.710
talk a little bit, did you ever see non Jewish eh Poles, did you  meet them, or

45:18.710 --> 45:18.710
Poi

45:18.710 --> 45:20.310
what was your relation?

45:20.310 --> 45:29.085
the relation we've had, my grandfather, my, from my father's family, he, they were living somewhere

45:29.085 --> 45:37.690
else in Siedliczcze in m, m, more like the middle of the city, mein aunty she was a very famous dress

45:37.690 --> 45:45.869
maker and my grandfather had somewhere like a shop with eh, where you can buy little things like

45:45.869 --> 45:52.770
paper and ink and pens and pencils, what you hebe, hebedeciary, do you call that?

45:52.770 --> 45:53.090
Yes, what

45:53.090 --> 46:00.986
Something like that, but that was more in the middle, like in, you know, that, that was open for the

46:00.986 --> 46:08.724
market place and all that and eh, what else can I mind,  Zelda's parents, that was, Zelda was my

46:08.724 --> 46:17.015
second cousin, she, her parents had eh, me, a shop material where to buy, do you know, for, for clothing,

46:17.015 --> 46:24.753
you know eh, in the middle there, their surname was Metz and eh was other family, you know, a lot,

46:24.753 --> 46:32.886
a lot, eh, someone, the family were in different cities. I had family like in Chelm, my grandmother's

46:32.886 --> 46:40.546
family and I had in Tomassovluensly , that's where my grandmother's eh son and daughter lives

46:40.546 --> 46:48.284
there like my mother's eh brother and sister lived there. They were not all in Siedliczcze, they

46:48.284 --> 46:56.101
were all scattered in Poland, you know, in different cities. You know, because eh  how shall I say,

46:56.101 --> 47:04.155
I went to school, my, my mother's eh sister used to come for the Jewish holidays over from  Tomaszow

47:04.155 --> 47:12.051
to us and she was a very good dress maker, so we used to wait for her to make us lovely dresses. And

47:12.051 --> 47:19.948
even for her own wedding, when she was getting married, we, we were all having, my sister had a navy

47:19.948 --> 47:27.844
blue with white and I had eh something a different color, but it was like eh sai, sailor clothes and

47:27.844 --> 47:35.503
new shoes, eh, shiny shoes and new socks and all that. And before the wedding we were all dressed

47:35.503 --> 47:43.320
up and mum said don't go outside because that particular time they were digging in Siedliczcze to

47:43.320 --> 47:51.138
put new pipes in for water, I don't know what they were digging then. We were seven or nine years

47:51.138 --> 47:59.271
old and mum said not to go close to there, but I wanted to have a look what's happening and I slipped

47:59.271 --> 48:07.167
and my sister wanted to pull me out and she fell in too and we came back for the wedding all in mud.

48:07.167 --> 48:14.826
And mum told us to stay in that room and never to come out. So that was the punishment because we

48:14.826 --> 48:16.090
didn't listen.

48:16.090 --> 48:23.420
Did, did you, did you have any contact with non Jewish, with the Poles?

48:23.420 --> 48:24.830
Oh yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

48:24.830 --> 48:24.830
That's my question.

48:24.830 --> 48:31.254
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh we lived in, the end of Siedliczcze were all our

48:31.254 --> 48:37.426
neighbours were Polish neighbours, we never had the Jewish neighbours and

48:37.426 --> 48:43.090
everybody across the road was eh  what was the name eh Roman eh, eh

48:43.090 --> 48:50.781
you know, in, in a minute the name will come, eh, they had a very beautiful eh fruit eh

48:50.781 --> 48:58.649
tree garden and his mother, he was a blacksmith. But this mother had a eh a flower garden

48:58.649 --> 49:05.279
and all, you know, when in Poland the  Corpus Christi, you've heard about

49:05.280 --> 49:05.280
Yes.

49:05.280 --> 49:14.274
they had four stations of the cross and from their garden all the stations for a bit, for, those flowers

49:14.274 --> 49:23.009
were made up the stations of the cross. And eh Roman eh, oh, what is the second name? It will come to

49:23.009 --> 49:31.830
me  and he had, you know, in the back, you know, very, very fruit garden, we used to and help him pick

49:31.830 --> 49:40.479
the apples, then we got the apples from them and even one day we saw grape fruit he had on the, the,

49:40.479 --> 49:49.128
the back of a very big eh  sh eh garage or something, he had grapes growing and Zelda was there with

49:49.128 --> 49:57.690
me and because she, we, we were the same age, and she was more at our place than at home because we

49:57.690 --> 50:06.943
were living outside, not the middle and we picked the grapes and we brought them in and mum nearly fainted,

50:06.943 --> 50:15.765
the grapes were not ripe and Roman knew how many bunges of grapes he had growing, put the grapes back,

50:15.765 --> 50:21.559
but we were so lucky that particular day [laughs], there was a tool

50:21.690 --> 50:21.910
Yes.

50:21.910 --> 50:29.236
and the grapes that, that thing was torn of the  wall and some of the grapes were lying ripe

50:29.236 --> 50:36.801
grapes them we picked were lying on the ground, so we were not [coughs], we were not punished.

50:36.801 --> 50:43.650
But mum said don't you dare go there anymore and listen what you were told [laughs].

50:44.270 --> 50:46.990
But you had good relations with

50:47.140 --> 50:55.016
Very good, no, not all, all our neighbours, we remember them and, and the school girls and all that,

50:55.016 --> 51:02.814
we always, they used to come over to our place on eh Pesach, they were always wanted to see what we

51:02.814 --> 51:10.533
eat, the matzes and all that, so we invited them. Not only that, but we never went on Saturdays to

51:10.533 --> 51:18.567
school and the Polish girls went to school, so we had our friends who gave us the homework, so we have

51:18.567 --> 51:26.758
to, have the homework made for Monday morning when we go to school. And the school was about a kilometre

51:26.758 --> 51:34.635
away from, from home. So in the summer we used to walk there, but in the winter my father had a sled

51:34.635 --> 51:42.432
and a horse, so we used to gather all the children on the way, it was about a kilometre and he used

51:42.432 --> 51:50.466
to take us all to school on the sled, but the horse knew the way [laughs], but he was taking us there.

51:50.466 --> 51:58.421
And the school was such a beautiful place, it was a castle. That castle was given to the city because

51:58.421 --> 52:06.298
he didn't have any heirs, so that particular castle was made up for the school. So you can imagine

52:06.298 --> 52:14.568
how beautiful our school was. Every class had those beautiful high ceilings and all ceiling was decorated

52:14.568 --> 52:22.366
and the heating was like white eh, eh what is it called eh  tiles,  white tiles and that was always

52:22.366 --> 52:30.085
done that, that heating was in two rooms and one room he used to put in the, the wood and the coal

52:30.085 --> 52:37.883
and it was closed after the smoke was gone, it used to closed up and that was heating for 24 hours.

52:37.883 --> 52:45.759
So that the school was heating that way. And we had a very big assembles eh place in the, in the ...

52:45.759 --> 52:53.793
all..was about a thou, thousand, in the morning there were the elderly, we had from, from se eh fifth,

52:53.793 --> 53:01.591
from fourth, fifth and sixth class was going in the morning and the younger children were there  in

53:01.591 --> 53:09.625
the afternoon. We had our classes from eight to one and eh there was about a thousand children in that

53:09.625 --> 53:17.344
school. And the assemble hall, where every class was standing in that classes assemble, we had all

53:17.344 --> 53:25.299
around the walls, was hangers with our name where we put our coats on, but the, the other things were

53:25.299 --> 53:33.018
going in the classes and the teachers, they were Polish teachers. One I had, a Jewish teacher, but

53:33.018 --> 53:41.131
she was teaching Polish, she was from Chelm [swallows], such a lovely woman. I still have got a picture

53:41.131 --> 53:42.469
of her, you know.

53:42.470 --> 53:44.600
You should show me later.

53:44.600 --> 53:54.385
I will show it to you, you know, I've got them all, standing there.  And if not I've got the albums

53:54.385 --> 54:03.696
and I'll show you all. She  was in the, for the Underground, for the Polish Underground. Because

54:03.696 --> 54:13.197
her husband was a Polish officer. And she eh helped a lot with the Underground. And somebody put her

54:13.197 --> 54:22.792
in and she was executed.  Yes, there was a lot, a lot to have to be careful to, when the Germans were

54:22.792 --> 54:32.388
there, quite a long time.  And eh  her brother [swallows] survived the war. He was as a Polish worker

54:32.388 --> 54:41.794
on the railways, but not an ordinary workers with the navy blue uniform, like, like  I don't know

54:41.794 --> 54:48.540
what the work was on the, with the rail and all that. And he survived.

54:48.540 --> 54:48.730
Hmhm.

54:48.730 --> 54:56.223
And Zelda later on, I knew, knew the parents, they lived in Chelm and Zelda mar, married a man,

54:56.223 --> 55:03.559
late cousin, she married him and I knew him very well too, before even, eh, you know, he, he

55:03.559 --> 55:11.052
before the war, because he was mein eldest brother's friend, with another friend who lived in

55:11.052 --> 55:18.703
Siedliczcze. It was all connected, you know, with, with Polish people and with eh, my father had,

55:18.703 --> 55:26.039
had that many Polish friend, when the winter used to come, they used to play cards here, the,

55:26.039 --> 55:33.375
the chief of police sitting with other people playing cards. Because wintertime was only time

55:33.375 --> 55:40.789
to play cards and my mum had to, to, to bake eh certain things so they would have to eat and a

55:40.789 --> 55:48.520
bottle of Wodka was on the table and sometimes they used to play cards till two or three o'clock

55:48.520 --> 55:55.855
in the morning [laughs]. You know, so we had a lot of beautiful Polish friends. We were never

55:55.855 --> 56:03.428
said go home or be cold, you know, that you, you were, we never had picket standing by, but Jews

56:03.428 --> 56:11.158
in the big cities, we had them in Chelm and in Lublin, they were standing in front of Jewish shops

56:11.158 --> 56:18.572
and buy only at Jewish places, but in, in Siedliczcze we never eh, eh, you know, lived through

56:18.572 --> 56:22.989
that, we never had any enemies. The Polish people eh, eh

56:22.990 --> 56:25.010
So that started with

56:25.010 --> 56:27.960
and anti, antisemitism, we never knew about antisemitism in Siedliczcze.

56:27.960 --> 56:28.210
Till the Germans came.

56:28.210 --> 56:32.670
Till the Germans came. They sorted

56:32.670 --> 56:32.790
And then you could not

56:32.790 --> 56:33.430
they

56:33.430 --> 56:34.570
go any longer to that

56:34.570 --> 56:35.230
they, they sorted

56:35.230 --> 56:35.650
beautiful school.

56:35.650 --> 56:44.180
they sorted us out. And there was another thing. A lot of Polish friend might be, would have helped

56:44.180 --> 56:52.711
a lot because a lot of them paid with their life. In Polish, when the Germans found a Jewish person

56:52.711 --> 57:01.156
hiding in a Polish family, the whole Polish family was executed. You know about that. But in other

57:01.156 --> 57:09.514
countries, like Czechoslovakia or other countries when the German did the Polish people were send

57:09.514 --> 57:17.959
to concentration camp, they were not executed.  Only in Poland. That's why when you, when I went

57:17.959 --> 57:26.489
to Israël [swallows] and I had a look at the Avenue of the Righteous the longest avenue was Polish

57:26.489 --> 57:35.020
people who helped Jews. Because every name had a tree.  You know. You know that. You see that I'm

57:35.020 --> 57:40.879
just didn't make it up, you know, that. How about we have a break?

57:40.880 --> 57:44.610
Sure, that's what I was going to suggest.

57:44.610 --> 57:46.110
there, it's all

57:46.570 --> 57:49.390
Okay, Regina, can you go on?

57:49.390 --> 57:49.680
Yes.

57:49.680 --> 57:53.660
Where we had stayed is eh, the Germans were there

57:53.660 --> 57:53.660
Yes.

57:53.660 --> 57:56.240
and you could not go to school any longer  eh

57:56.240 --> 57:56.240
No.

57:56.240 --> 58:05.160
and so one day you could not even go to your house anymore.

58:05.160 --> 58:13.207
That was  eh when we were all assigned to work for that outside, it was about a kilometre

58:13.207 --> 58:21.706
or more to walk to that river where we have to, to, to  to straighten it and that was, I think

58:21.706 --> 58:28.940
I mentioned the date, that was the 18th of May, when it started with the ghetto.

58:29.490 --> 58:34.050
But before that you had to work on the river, that was before the ghetto?

58:34.050 --> 58:39.530
That was, yes, but, people still walking home every day when we finished work,

58:39.530 --> 58:44.590
we were walking home, but the 18th of May we couldn't go home anymore.

58:44.590 --> 58:48.870
You had to go to the ghetto.

58:48.870 --> 58:53.410
We have straight, they have, during the day they did something,

58:53.410 --> 58:57.590
cornered off quite a few streets  and that was the ghetto.

58:57.590 --> 59:06.470
Can we before go to  the river? Can you describe me a day in which you worked at the river?

59:06.470 --> 59:13.931
Yes. We had eh to assemble, but I can't remember exactly where everybody, because there were a

59:13.931 --> 59:21.393
lot of people from different places, but we have to assemble at the river there, because we knew

59:21.393 --> 59:29.088
where we were going and I think we were counted there is every, everybody there. I can't remember

59:29.088 --> 59:36.628
that exactly, because sometimes, you know, I was walking with, with my parents and with my sister

59:36.628 --> 59:44.012
and sometimes with other people, because we were assigned over there, at the spot where we were

59:44.012 --> 59:51.397
working to different spots where that have to be, the engineer marked it out where it has to be

59:51.397 --> 59:58.858
and there was a lot of Germans watching us too, not just eh, you know, that eh other, we, we, we

59:58.858 --> 01:00:06.398
didn't have any foremens there. We didn't have anybody who would come and hurry up and do it,

01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:13.782
we have to do that in a day, we were marked out for instance a square metre, I have to dig  and

01:00:13.782 --> 01:00:21.555
that I have to do today and if it's done before, then I had to go and help out others. It wasn't

01:00:21.555 --> 01:00:29.173
that we were told hurry up and do it, we didn't have that when we were coming from home to work.

01:00:29.173 --> 01:00:34.070
And everybody was fifteen and over had to, to assign for work.

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:40.680
Also your mother and father?

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:49.261
Yes. Yes.  Only my grandmother and greatgrandmother, they were staying home. And then one day, I don't

01:00:49.261 --> 01:00:57.678
know how that came about [swallows] that meine grandmother and greatgrandmother and they eh neighbour,

01:00:57.678 --> 01:01:06.259
a very good friend of my grandmother, Mrs Carp, they, they predicted something was going to be happening

01:01:06.259 --> 01:01:14.511
today and they didn't want to go home, but my father has, has made a eh a double eh wall in one of

01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:22.762
the sheds where the material, the building material was and that was, it didn't look like it's a

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:31.344
separate wall, because that was done up like the outside wall with straw because for the winter that's

01:01:31.344 --> 01:01:39.677
had to be protected and eh they  hi, were hiding there. Because they couldn't go to work, they were

01:01:39.677 --> 01:01:48.672
too old for work. But normally they stayed at home and now, and n, nothing was happening, but that particular

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:57.171
day, I don't know what it was, that they, they were hiding, I can't recall why. And then they, they

01:01:57.171 --> 01:02:05.340
c, we couldn't go back home that particular day, that was the 18th of May. And when we came back

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:13.921
[sighs] it was something that is hard to describe, we were giving outside  eh, it was still  Siedliczcze

01:02:13.921 --> 01:02:22.255
but it was more outside, a little cottage where a tailor lives, and there was only two people in that

01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:30.672
little cottage and the tailor because he had that room to do the sowing, all our family was  in there.

01:02:30.672 --> 01:02:33.230
And my grandmother was with us.

01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:36.640
She had come from the old house?

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:43.317
No, from that, from the normal house, you know, because she was hiding. All the, oh,

01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:50.312
I forgot to tell you. The one who were not that particular day at work, were taken away.

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:57.069
All the sick, all the young who couldn't work, the children, a lot of children were

01:02:57.069 --> 01:03:03.985
left with their grandparents and the young was going to work, they were taken away that

01:03:03.985 --> 01:03:09.470
day. And nobody saw them anymore. Where they were taking nobody knew.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.440
But your grandmother managed to escape?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:21.318
Managed to, the, my greatgrandmother she was with, with eh somebody else then, that particular day,

01:03:21.318 --> 01:03:29.927
but I don't know [swallows] how to explain that. Because they were different places where the,

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:38.716
the people could be, oh,  could be assembled and my grandmother was still with us in that cottage,

01:03:38.716 --> 01:03:47.505
but I don't know where greatgrandmother went. To somebody else's eh place there were more room

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:56.114
maybe, but still in the ghetto.  And that was something that eh was hard to describe. To leave a

01:03:56.114 --> 01:04:04.723
beautiful big house and to be squeezed in  in a small place like that.  It had, no, it was still

01:04:04.723 --> 01:04:13.692
summer because May just started, on the spring, and we were there till [swallows] even, till October

01:04:13.692 --> 01:04:19.880
the 22nd. But in the meantime my eldest brother passed away, whenever

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:19.880
Yes, you told so.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:27.857
they was, and that was the, the, eh   Rosj Hasjana eve. The 11th of September. And, by cleaning

01:04:27.857 --> 01:04:36.422
the bricks from the synagogue because they burned down the synagogue. And they were even stand against

01:04:36.422 --> 01:04:44.987
laughing, and the [Jews] were standing, we couldn't do anything. And they took all the jews together

01:04:44.987 --> 01:04:52.964
in the middle of the synagogue and lit them and they were laughing that nobody managed to, they

01:04:52.964 --> 01:05:01.110
said what Jews are they, yet, that you don't go to save your scrolls. They meant the Thora's.

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:07.240
You know. How could anybody jump into a f, middle of a fire to save them.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:16.200
But that day you didn't have to work? Because you did see that?

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.680
Yes, we were working. We were working during the day and that was in the evening.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.140
That was in the evening?

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.370
In the evening they burned the synagogue down. Yes.

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.240
Hmhm.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:34.080
And later on mine eldest brother was assigned to clean the bricks, that was in September.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:34.080
Hmhm.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.440
You know. I don't know exactly what month and when the synagogue was

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:40.230
That doesn't matter.

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.230
was, but, burned.

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.230
Doesn't matter.

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:48.029
It was between the 18th of May  till September when my brother passed away, that was already

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:55.660
burnt down. Because there were four of them, were cleaning the bricks from young men.  And

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.050
Was it very hard work?

01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:03.501
It was a very hot day and all that to sit outside in the sun and we had only something

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:09.727
to eat in the morning and during the work there wasn't any break. And w, and when

01:06:09.727 --> 01:06:15.953
we were working with the, the river digging, it wasn't so bad because it wasn't

01:06:15.953 --> 01:06:22.029
that hot, but they were sitting, the men were sitting, the young men were sitting

01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:27.129
and cleaning bricks and a ver, it was a very hot September day. Yes.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.780
When you say it wasn't so bad with the water digging

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:32.520
No, but

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.780
I imagine you were fifteen years old

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.240
Yes, yes.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.320
so it must have been very hard work for a small girl

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:45.536
It was h, it was hard, but sometimes, you know, when you get a sandy, sandy place, it wasn't

01:06:45.536 --> 01:06:53.752
that hard, we didn't have to every, maybe to go that deep, it all depends, somet, my dear eh

01:06:53.752 --> 01:07:01.968
Selma, we were helping out one another. It wasn't that, that it was a s, not like in a camp,

01:07:01.968 --> 01:07:10.534
it was just coming out from home to do the work and we had to do that today and if eh was somebody

01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:18.925
got something harder, so the other person who had a little bit lighter went to help. So that was

01:07:18.925 --> 01:07:26.180
done today. Yes. And eh that was why, you know, that engineer, he was so fair. With

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.200
He was?

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:34.619
the work. He was very fair with work. You know. And it was still summertime, so we never worried,

01:07:34.619 --> 01:07:41.810
even if we stand in water or not. But it was different  when you sit all day and clean bricks.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:42.330
Absolutely!

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:44.560
Yes.

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:49.000
So people helped each other and  at the digging and the waterworks?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.120
Yes they would, yes, the, the, the

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.440
Did you get any food during the day?

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.240
No, we, we didn't, oh no, if you bring something from home

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:57.890
Yes?

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:04.105
yes, then, then we had something to eat, but we, we still had, you know,

01:08:04.105 --> 01:08:09.760
it wasn't rationed then, even, you know, we were not in ghetto then,

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.930
but later on in ghetto it wasn't so easy. It wasn't so easy.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.170
Because you were hungry?

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:22.226
[whispers] Oh yes. But my mother saw, my, I don't know how she managed, you know, after

01:08:22.226 --> 01:08:28.215
work she, she was crawling into the garden and picking some vegetables and something and

01:08:28.215 --> 01:08:34.407
all away, she not, didn't take long, you know, a pot of soup for the, even there wasn't

01:08:34.407 --> 01:08:40.260
much to put in, but pepper maybe and salt, but there was something to eat, you know. A

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:46.180
potatoe and a carrrot and then maybe, I don't know what else, a bean, whatever it was

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:50.739
growing, we all helped, you know. And there was still enough bread.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:54.190
Was it far away?

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:56.640
Eh to, to work?

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:56.830
Yes.

01:08:56.830 --> 01:09:00.135
About a kilometre. Sometimes a bit more, sometimes less.

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.850
It all depends how the river was flowing. Yes.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.380
So that's okay.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:12.565
Yes, that was okay. Yes. We've used to walk. You know.  But later on when it got colder

01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:20.842
it wasn't so easy. The worst part was in that slave lamber, labour camp in Staw. Because

01:09:20.842 --> 01:09:28.660
we were taking away from Siedliczcze the 22nd of October. And October is late autumn.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.180
Yes.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:38.980
That was starting to get cold. And in November sometime the eh it was freezing.  That was hell!

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.580
In Staw you wouldn't come home again? You would stay there?

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:43.730
Pardon?

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:49.810
When you worked in Staw. Did you  enter  come back home in the evening or?

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.730
No, not home. No. To the g, ghetto.

01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:54.000
To the ghetto, yes.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.340
To the ghetto, yes. Yes, from Staw we were coming home from, from the ghe, from work to the ghetto.

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.770
And was that further away?

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:06.120
No the ghetto was outside eh of Staw, yes.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:06.950
Yes?

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:16.764
No, sorry, sorry, we did come home from the ghetto.  We were taking away [swallows] to Staw the 22nd

01:10:16.764 --> 01:10:26.031
of October and it was a camp there. That was a very old mill, was converted, they were making in that

01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:35.389
mill eh  eh, eh banks   banks  and they were straw on the bank  on the thing and we were  getting some

01:10:35.389 --> 01:10:45.206
blankets, that was all. But it was already so cold and the work outside all day. But my mother was assigned

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:54.564
to the kitchen. So eh you know sometimes you know, when we finished there was soup, but the soup where

01:10:54.564 --> 01:11:03.738
they were putting in oats in the soup, and potatoes. And mum used to say be careful when you eat the

01:11:03.738 --> 01:11:12.821
soup because the, the oats were not cleaned like we have now porrigde from oats, the, the oats were

01:11:12.821 --> 01:11:22.088
just crushed and the  was still on it. So she used to say be careful when you eat and if you get some

01:11:22.088 --> 01:11:31.629
potatoes in it, you might be even better to wash off  the soup from the potatoe because if a  gets stuck

01:11:31.629 --> 01:11:37.410
in the throat it's worse than a bone, you can't get it out.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:38.150
Yes.

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:46.902
So we had to be so careful with the soup when we were having it. But that was in Staw, when we arrived

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:55.569
in Staw there wasn't anymore like in the ghetto, it was the mill. And there was three or two, three

01:11:55.569 --> 01:12:05.180
wire fences all around and there was eh, eh Germans with dogs. We had to give up our clothes to be desinfectant,

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:13.847
but we were wearing it and we were getting it back and then  every day to work, with in the morning a

01:12:13.847 --> 01:12:22.857
slice of bread and eh as eh a  of hot water. They called it coffee, it was brown water, but we were happy

01:12:22.857 --> 01:12:31.696
it was hot. And then when we were coming back was the soup. And that where my  mother was then assigned

01:12:31.696 --> 01:12:40.363
to, in the kitchen. Not to go to work, but my father was still coming all of us, the family. Only not

01:12:40.363 --> 01:12:49.202
my eldest brother. He p, he passed away in September.  I remember I had a dream about him. And, and eh,

01:12:49.202 --> 01:12:57.783
eh, I, I complained that much and even mum said you don't have to worry about it, we know where he

01:12:57.783 --> 01:13:06.536
is and that what he, he said in the dream. You never know where you are going.  The certain things you

01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:15.460
know, I used to have dreams, I wish I had dreams now, but I don't dream now. Maybe I do, but I don't

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:24.556
remember when I wake up. I had once a dream that my mother, we were in a very, very big hall and my mother

01:13:24.556 --> 01:13:33.137
was coming in from the rain, she had a raincoat with a hood on. And she came in, I knew she wasn't

01:13:33.137 --> 01:13:41.976
alive with us and I went over to her and ask her mum where ever you are, is it very hard, very bad? And

01:13:41.976 --> 01:13:50.557
she said my daughter, we have to earn, we have to work everywhere to earn our place.  I wish I could

01:13:50.557 --> 01:13:59.310
say it in a bit of Jiddisch, in a bit of Polish, the way she was talking in that dream. When I talk to

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.369
you I still can see her.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.500
Can you tell in Jiddish?

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.850
Oh we used to speak a lot of Jiddish.

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:06.820
No, but can you tell me now what she

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:07.050
No

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:07.940
said to you, in Jiddish?

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:14.087
no, no, because I tried to get the Jiddish language out when I was in German, because

01:14:14.087 --> 01:14:20.163
I was afraid it will come up in Jiddish and they will recognise me that I'm, I'm

01:14:20.163 --> 01:14:26.528
Jewish, so I just wanted so quickly to learn German and now when I want to speak Jiddish

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:30.940
it comes out German. But Jiddish songs I still remember. Yes.

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:34.860
But when you talk about your mother ta, talking to you

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.490
can you say it to me in German then?

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:44.996
In German she said Mein Tochter, eh, eh we, we have,

01:14:44.996 --> 01:14:52.070
no, you see, it comes in, in English  I, Ich, Ich

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.070
Wir haben

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:53.490
Wir mÃ¼ssen  no I cannot

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.340
Unsere Stelle verdienen onder so etwas?

01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:05.144
something like that, Wir, Wir mÃ¼ssen verdienen eh unser, unser Leben or our, our, it's something

01:15:05.144 --> 01:15:14.552
you know, but I still can see her when she said eh we have to earn our  maybe it was different,

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:21.980
because I still can see her in, in, in that grey raincoat.  Anyhow [sighs].

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:26.000
Your father was older and he had to work also in the waterworks?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.014
No, he wasn't much older, he was only three years older than

01:15:30.014 --> 01:15:33.900
my mother. My mother was 42 and my father was 45 when we got

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.800
But for a man of 45

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.050
five, yes

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:37.120
to work in the water

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.100
Yes?

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.010
that kind of hard labour must have been

01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.480
Every, everybody

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:40.820
different.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:47.160
you know. And my sister, she was only eighteen months older than I was. And the

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:53.020
youngest brother he was hiding. He was hiding in, in Staw, he was hiding.

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.570
Explain to me

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:55.980
I don't know

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.860
how could he do it?

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:05.067
I d, I don't know how he did it, but he found a kettle, a, you know when you boiled water for tea

01:16:05.067 --> 01:16:13.275
or something and he used to fill it up behind, it was still the camp, but behind that mill he found

01:16:13.275 --> 01:16:21.400
a place where he could gather eh dry pieces of wood if it was cold, it wasn't always raining, it

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:29.442
wasn't always snowing, it was October, and he used to lit the fire when he said mum, nobody can

01:16:29.442 --> 01:16:37.567
see me and he used to boil water in that kettle  and he was only eleven years old and then we came

01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:44.200
back from work so we had some hot water, before we got that little  bit of soup.

01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:48.010
Did you sleep with the family in Staw?

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:48.720
Yes. Yes.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.360
You had a corner in the

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:57.090
No, the men were separate from the woman, but we was on eh, we used to call it Pritze

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:57.360
Yes?

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:04.060
Yes, and that was  so we used to huddle together so we had another blanket, because we had to cover

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:10.490
the snow with one blanket, the straw, with one blanket and cover ourselves on with another one.

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.710
Hmhm.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:19.562
You know. I had, still had my coat, my mother had a winter, winter stuff on thanks to that engineer.

01:17:19.562 --> 01:17:28.237
We got a lot of winter stuff out from the, from home, because we still had it in Siedliczcze where

01:17:28.237 --> 01:17:36.470
we were working. In ghetto. So we had a lot of winter stuff with us. And that saved us a lot.

01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:39.700
The engineer was Polish or German?

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:50.241
Polish engineer, Polish. Kiendracki. Yes, he was a, and the two girls, the, the, the Irene, Irene

01:17:50.241 --> 01:18:00.130
and Myszka, she was the daughter of a eh Polish senator.  W, w, not Wisotsky eh  Wasynczuk.

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:00.320
Hmhm.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:09.084
You see, if I try I remember the name, Wisotsky was somebody else. Yes. Two sisters. They were

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:17.290
lovely girls, that sister helped me later on a lot. When I was escaping. That will come.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:25.950
[coughs] So eh  it was a rough life in Staw? It was very hard?

01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:28.250
Very hard because it was cold. Terribly cold.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.660
And you ?

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:38.565
Yes. And there's another incident, but that was already wintertime. That was already in December.

01:18:38.565 --> 01:18:48.128
It was snowing and on Sunday we never used to go to work. Saturday sometimes only half a day. And Sundays

01:18:48.128 --> 01:18:57.508
not, we had to clean up the camp.  And the whole world was covered in snow and it looked like a picture

01:18:57.508 --> 01:19:06.888
card, you know. The wintertime. And we were outside and then we saw outside one of the fences two black

01:19:06.888 --> 01:19:16.450
dots. And the dots were coming closer and closer [scrapes throat] and when they were very close we heard,

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:25.557
we saw it was two boys. Crying and calling out for their mother. Because their mother and father was

01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:35.210
in the camp [coughs], oh pardon me [scrapes throat] but their grandfather was one of the highest decorated

01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:44.317
Polish soldier for the First Worldwar,  and he, they had a very, the, the government gave him a very

01:19:44.317 --> 01:19:53.333
good position. He had the, the  where they eh have spirits and wine to sell, because that was under

01:19:53.333 --> 01:20:02.531
government law, nobody can have it, that in private. And that was the grandson's twins, eight years

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:11.638
old twins for that and the parents were already in Staw working. And when they were close enough, we

01:20:11.638 --> 01:20:20.836
recognised and the parents recognised them. And one of the SS-men or German, I don't know if he was

01:20:20.836 --> 01:20:29.852
SS or just a soldier, he took out  the German sheperd, what you, they were circling the camp around

01:20:29.852 --> 01:20:38.867
and I don't have to paint you the picture what they did to the two boys. And we couldn't help.

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:47.974
Oh gosh, that was something that it's hard to and describe.  Mother was behind and my sister were

01:20:47.974 --> 01:20:57.081
behind and we looked at each other  I don't know if I said it or my sister said it, if they can do

01:20:57.081 --> 01:21:06.188
that to two children  what can we expect from them for us?  The things we never get any  answers for

01:21:06.188 --> 01:21:15.477
that. Because later on on life I had hear a professor who was teaching in Adelaide University religion

01:21:15.477 --> 01:21:24.584
and Jewish religion and he was a doctor, professor doctor and all that and we were very good friends

01:21:24.584 --> 01:21:33.782
and we used to talk a lot and one day he said, everything what happened in our life is for a purpose.

01:21:33.782 --> 01:21:42.980
And I said, doctor, and I forgot his name, I've got his address there, tell me, was the Holo, what

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:52.087
purpose was the Holocaust?  And he said I don't have an answer for that.  There isn't any answer

01:21:52.087 --> 01:22:01.376
for that. No. The only thing was annoyed us and that much was to the rest was doing nothing. Roosevelt

01:22:01.376 --> 01:22:11.302
knew about it since 1942  because we after the war, in the museum, in Sydney Jewish museum we had newspapers,

01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:20.500
the New York Times, the Chicago, what was it, Chicago's newspaper, anyhow, you know what I mean, it

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:29.607
was the heading, was 1942, what they were doing, what Hitler is doing to the Jews and Roosevelt said

01:22:29.607 --> 01:22:38.714
don't worry we are going to win, to win the war. And that was three more years of war when he said

01:22:38.714 --> 01:22:39.169
that.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:46.760
But when you were there  you had no news about the war?

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:46.760
No, no, no.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.000
Because this is after Stalingrad.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.490
Yes.

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:50.970
So the German were losing the war already.

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:50.970
Yes.

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:54.440
But you didn't, you didn't know about Stalingrad?

01:22:54.440 --> 01:23:07.219
I didn't know. No. No. But when the eh transport of the Russian prisoners of war, Jewish prisoners

01:23:07.219 --> 01:23:18.210
of war, they were still in the uniform, that was the 23rd of September nineteen fourty

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.513
three.  And then they were telling us  that they are losing the war. And we

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:30.150
can't wait any longer because we'll be all killed. Pechersky helped

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:31.990
Yes, but that's later on.

01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:33.190
helped us. Yes.

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:37.710
Let's, do you mind to go back to Staw, because it must have been unbearibly cold!

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:45.396
It was hard to describe.  I don't know, please don't ask me, how we survived, because

01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:53.000
sometimes we used to say it was too much to die and not enough for living, I mean the food.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.772
We used to pray nothing much but the daily bread, you know, how we, we, we pray, our father,

01:24:00.772 --> 01:24:08.209
you know, the prayer might be in Jiddish, is not like that because we used to pray it in,

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:15.646
in Hebrew and I did, didn't understand Hebrew, so I liked to pray it in, in Polish, our

01:24:15.646 --> 01:24:23.500
father, you know, it is exactly the same word that is in English, you know. All we were asking

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:29.350
was our daily bread, nothing else.  Because bread was so holy in camp.

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:35.570
But it must also have been very dirty? Dirty

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.710
Yes.

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:37.580
you must have become very dirty.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.700
Yes.

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.440
Did you still have your period then, or?

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:47.510
No I had, didn't have the period for about eight months. It stopped.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:50.420
Hmhm.

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:57.627
Yes. I don't know, and because eh that stopped so I used to get boils all over me.

01:24:57.627 --> 01:25:05.006
And standing in the water and that cold, cold sinc and all that, I don't know how my

01:25:05.006 --> 01:25:11.870
mother see how we were suffering, how she survived.  My father was a strong man.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.340
He was?

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:22.166
Yes.  Even my brother after me, he, even if he was a lot younger, he was stronger than, than maybe

01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:30.232
I was, I don't know. I  the size I'm today I think I didn't grow since I was twelve. I've got

01:25:30.232 --> 01:25:37.580
here in Australia a good excuse, I was born in a small country, not in a continent [laughs].

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:41.580
Okay. How did you learn you had to move from Staw?

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.800
We were told

01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:44.080
Yes?

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:52.985
in the morning that we are not going to work and, and a lot of farmers have assembled with wagons

01:25:52.985 --> 01:26:01.982
and eh horsedriven wagons and they were eh women with, with a little bit, sisters are eh you know,

01:26:01.982 --> 01:26:10.888
daughters were sitting on a certain wagons and the men were separate on other wagons. And we were

01:26:10.888 --> 01:26:18.599
told that we are going to another camp.  And where we were going they never told us.

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:24.348
Yes, that's how you started talking this interview,

01:26:24.348 --> 01:26:29.380
when you said when the, you took the road to Wlodawa

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:29.600
To Wlodawa, yes.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:29.600
you realised that

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.780
Yes, not we realised the, the brother said something.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:30.780
Yes.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:38.164
Let's say goodbye to the night because we won't see the sunrise. Yes. But we,

01:26:38.164 --> 01:26:44.910
we never be, couldn't understand what he was saying, what it meant. Yes.

01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:51.400
So, since you started talking about how you  elected yourself for knitting

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.410
Yes.

01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:59.739
you already told that, eh  you landed up at this shed in Sobibor for knitting.

01:26:59.739 --> 01:27:06.600
And that's where we had gone to and then, since that we have come back.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.430
No.

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:09.390
You remember?

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.340
Where, what is

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.960
How the interview went? You started the interview with the knitting room.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.580
Knitting room, yes.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.800
And so, let's pick up from there again.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:26.185
Yes, from there, yes, alright, then we were knitting, we had to do, first of all they brought,

01:27:26.185 --> 01:27:33.492
they b, eh fixed up the, the barrack for us and a very big table and chairs and they brought,

01:27:33.492 --> 01:27:41.035
they gave us a potbelly little stove and they gave us one bucket of fuel, some wood to start and

01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:48.657
then coal and we used to keep that for the evening because that, the evening was the coldest and,

01:27:48.657 --> 01:27:56.042
and then we could knit a little bit from the, when they, curfew was at eight o'clock so they

01:27:56.042 --> 01:28:04.057
switched off the light. Sometimes it was impossible to do one sock, we had to undo beautiful cardigans

01:28:04.057 --> 01:28:11.521
and jumpers and they were from all over Europe, you know, and then we had to, from that wool we

01:28:11.521 --> 01:28:18.985
had to knit a sock a day. Some of us were doing fast the leg and some of us could do better the

01:28:18.985 --> 01:28:26.842
heel or the, the toes, so we used to, to, how shall I say, help ourselves out, so that we haven't,

01:28:26.842 --> 01:28:30.849
we had to have a half a dozen socks in the morning.

01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:32.870
Did you always manage

01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:40.940
Eh we managed, because the, the flicker of the  from the fire, when the light was switched off and when

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:49.011
we had that little potbelly for the eh night, so we had a little bit warm where to sleep. And there was

01:28:49.011 --> 01:28:57.082
another thing, there were twelve of us in all because there was a real young girl, Irene, she did a lot

01:28:57.082 --> 01:29:05.153
of help with her mother and her brother, they were knitting and  they had to undo first, we all helped,

01:29:05.153 --> 01:29:13.224
we all helped each other. We just didn't think you can or you can't, we have to do it. And whatever

01:29:13.224 --> 01:29:21.216
it was possible to do it in a way that what we were trying to do and then [swallows] eh when the, the,

01:29:21.216 --> 01:29:29.130
the socks were ready in the morning, they used to count, that's another thing, there was only three

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:36.966
or four of us, because it was three layers and I was assigned to the top thing in the, the, the  the

01:29:36.966 --> 01:29:44.880
roof from the barrack, was like that. And it didn't have a ceiling. So if I have meine toes there,

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:53.342
meine toes were freezing and if I had meine head there on the end, you know, there, meine head was freezing.

01:29:53.342 --> 01:30:01.413
So the girls made room, another three to fit in on the, on the first or the second one, so we were just

01:30:01.413 --> 01:30:05.409
packed in like, like eh  sardines, no [laughs], no

01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:05.410
Yes

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:11.560
hard to, yes

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:11.660
Yes.

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:21.970
yes, but we managed, nobody was on top, it was impossible in the winter.

01:30:21.970 --> 01:30:22.100
Because the roof was not really closed.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:23.658
No, that roof was closed but it wasn't a ceiling. And the, the

01:30:23.658 --> 01:30:25.070
roof was covered with, eh, what is that, that iron called?

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.270
Straw?

01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:29.600
Co eh, eh  how, cord

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:29.830
Cardboard?

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:33.760
you know, that, that, that roof cover, what is that eh  iron, iron roof

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.710
I understand.

01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:36.230
an iron roof.

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.280
An iron roof, yes.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:45.828
Yes. Yes. And that was colder than wood or anything else. You know. In the winter. But we managed somehow

01:30:45.828 --> 01:30:54.050
to do it and we even managed to knit something else and, they, which I want German is not supposed to

01:30:54.050 --> 01:31:02.435
know from another and we ask you know to, and only once was somebody brought in maybe a slice of bread,

01:31:02.435 --> 01:31:10.739
was someone, one German brought in some sugarcubes, but what do you do with, so I hid mine in a little

01:31:10.739 --> 01:31:19.695
pocket I had there and eh  anyhow, that was something, but that was from the sowing room when I was [swallos].

01:31:19.695 --> 01:31:28.080
And when the knitting, shall I tell when the knitting finished or shall we still do the knitting during

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:36.628
the winter. And in spring  the knitting was finished.  We were assigned to different work.  First I think

01:31:36.628 --> 01:31:45.013
was assigned to the forest. Because the men was cutting off branches so a horseman can ride through the

01:31:45.013 --> 01:31:53.236
forest and we had to take the branches away into the camp. They needed that wood for the crematorium.

01:31:53.236 --> 01:32:01.458
And eh then, after that we were assigned, there were little bunkers in the forest and there was only

01:32:01.458 --> 01:32:09.844
the roof was sticking under, were two steps to go down, or three, and there was Russian ammunition that

01:32:09.844 --> 01:32:18.473
they, from the Russian front, what they, the Germans eh, because in the beginning the Russians was losing,

01:32:18.473 --> 01:32:27.021
so they had the Russian ammunition there, we had to clean that. And then sometimes we had to unload other

01:32:27.021 --> 01:32:35.570
things and other things and then I was taking to the sorting eh garage. And the sorting was the clothing.

01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:43.955
Everything good has to be sorted out different. And that was going straight to Germany. They'd showed

01:32:43.955 --> 01:32:52.666
us how to, to rip up the bundles, the good stuff. And they had three or four glass containers on a separate

01:32:52.666 --> 01:33:00.888
table. And when you find money or goods, whatever it was hidden and we were finding it, we had to put

01:33:00.888 --> 01:33:09.030
it in there. If you hide it, you get shot on the way, on the, on the  that's got, for the Germans.

01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:17.171
And then was eh, when, where I was doing that, there was a brought onto the table a bundle  and I n,

01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:25.719
nearly froze, standing looking at it and the girls ask what's happening to you? That brown jack, jacket

01:33:25.719 --> 01:33:34.267
that is my mother's jacket. A winter jacket.  Oh she said don't be, I said it in, in English, don't

01:33:34.267 --> 01:33:42.408
be  your transport was in December and it's now May, it wouldn't lay here about there that long.

01:33:42.408 --> 01:33:50.630
I said I can prove it to you. My mother hid, there was a breast pocket on each side, she p eh hid her

01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:59.016
wedding ring in the lining.  I said if you will watch out for me and I'm strong enough  and even when

01:33:59.016 --> 01:34:07.483
I'm not strong enough, we always had sci, scissors lying about because we were ripping up the bundles,

01:34:07.483 --> 01:34:15.868
we had to cut off the strings and things like that, and I'll rip off the lining on the pocket and you

01:34:15.868 --> 01:34:24.253
will see there's my mother's ring there. And it was my mother's jacket. I couldn't give up that

01:34:24.253 --> 01:34:32.394
ring. But the floor boards were not close by, it was eh, eh a distant from one board to the other, I

01:34:32.394 --> 01:34:40.861
could fit meine toes into the sand because the board were lying on sand. And I fit on and I dropped that

01:34:40.861 --> 01:34:49.165
ring and covered it up in the sand. I didn't give it up. I couldn't hide it with me, if they would

01:34:49.165 --> 01:34:54.782
have found it, I would have been shot.  But I couldn't give it up.-

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:57.770
Did you have a phantasy to find it?

01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:00.440
Oh how, meine dear

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:00.890
Yes.

01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:06.263
Selma, how, we never been back, never been back to Sobibor. And Sobibor,

01:35:06.263 --> 01:35:11.563
the Germans  dugged everything up and they even, you know, they planted

01:35:11.563 --> 01:35:16.340
tr, a new forest, you know. They, it, it was imp, maybe somebody

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.060
sp SL I know, I know.

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:22.113
maybe somebody found it, but not me and not, nobody from us

01:35:22.113 --> 01:35:25.960
went ever back during the war when, you know, they, they

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.450
No, but, but I'm asking when you hid the ring

01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:29.790
The ring, yes.

01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:35.690
did you then have a fantasy to  be ever able to dig it up again, or?

01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:40.740
I never dreamed I would pick it up again, but I didn't give it up to the Germans.

01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:41.210
Okay.

01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:47.808
Whatever will find it, good luck to them. You know. But not to give it up,

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:54.050
that would have gone straight with other jewelry to Germany. You know.

01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.050
Hmhm.

01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:58.508
I never, never dreamed about it. Anyhow. What they, they, when we escaped, what

01:35:58.508 --> 01:36:02.910
they did to that camp, later on I found out, I didn't know it straight away.

01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:08.120
It must have been a terrible confrontation suddenly with the jacket of your mother.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:08.540
Oh I knew I

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:11.670
Because you must have missed her so much.

01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:18.989
I knew, I knew what was, I knew what happening to the family, but now I have her clothing

01:36:18.989 --> 01:36:26.309
in meine hand  was a, a woolen, even  the lable for that, the, the tailor who made it was

01:36:26.309 --> 01:36:33.464
Offenbach from Lublin.  You know. It was a beautiful winter jacket, it was lined and in

01:36:33.464 --> 01:36:40.702
between the lining there was still warm stuff in there. Like our coats, the winter coats

01:36:40.702 --> 01:36:48.103
had inside like, like felt or something very light stuff. But in layer, before the lining,

01:36:48.103 --> 01:36:54.189
so it will be warm. You know, it wasn't, the winters were not like here.

01:36:54.190 --> 01:36:54.190
No.

01:36:54.190 --> 01:37:04.705
Yes. We needed the warm stuff. Anyhow, and then [swallows]  just as well  the 23rd of September

01:37:04.705 --> 01:37:15.000
did the Russian transport came in.  And amongst them was a lieutenant with the name Alexander

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.970
Pechersky and we called him Sascha. In Russia Alexander they call Sacha.

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:23.370
Sascha, yes.

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:32.012
Yes. Even he, but he was seeing and hearing what was going on, he said eh that he's got a three

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:40.476
years old daughter in Russia [swallows], he himself was a music teacher. But in the army he was

01:37:40.476 --> 01:37:49.208
lieutenant. And there was a lot of other Russian soldiers with him. And we already had in the camp

01:37:49.208 --> 01:37:57.672
somebody with the name of ehLeon Feldhendler. And they were, he and other m, men were planning,

01:37:57.672 --> 01:38:06.048
because one escaped, we had to pay a very high price. If they caught that one, then or a dozen

01:38:06.048 --> 01:38:14.512
others were shot from the camp and the ones who were, you know, it was hard to describe, and we

01:38:14.512 --> 01:38:23.066
said either, ei we go all or not at all. And that was, Pechersky helped out because he had a lot

01:38:23.066 --> 01:38:31.441
of military experience. And then it started. It started, it started and we were always waiting

01:38:31.441 --> 01:38:37.500
for Wagner. I never told you about what I lived through in the camp.

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:37.500
Tell me.

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:45.914
[sighs] I was working in, in a, a laundry.  And I wasn't well, I had a terrible headache and it

01:38:45.914 --> 01:38:54.503
wasn't a headache you know, it was a earache. A middle ear infection, I know now what it was, but

01:38:54.503 --> 01:39:02.918
then I didn't know. And maybe I was just standing and waiting for the hot water, maybe that was

01:39:02.918 --> 01:39:11.853
my excuse, because I needed a little bit of warm  for my hands. And I wasn't eh, make myself working,

01:39:11.853 --> 01:39:20.615
I was standing, I don't know what happened with me then. And the German came in. One of the guards,

01:39:20.615 --> 01:39:29.030
I think his name was Kam [spells] K A N, A M. And he said, because I wasn't working, he took me

01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:37.618
out, outside and that particular day Wagner, he was the most ferocius be, no I shouldn't call him

01:39:37.618 --> 01:39:46.120
beast, because a beast doesn't kill for nothing, it's either they defend themselve or they are

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:54.534
hungry, but he was killing people for nothing, to, took me out and Wagner had just standing there

01:39:54.534 --> 01:40:02.863
with his dog, and  a pile of wood the men was shopping the wood, and that was about that high, a

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:11.191
pile of wood and he told him that I wasn't working, he told me to bend down and then even told

01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:19.692
me to lift my skirt up.  And they had the, the whips, about a meter long  anyhow, you to, sh, cut,

01:40:19.692 --> 01:40:23.769
I remember where I finished, you are too tired.

01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:24.550
No.

01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:27.610
No?

01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:28.450
No!

01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:28.510
Oh.

01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.510
I'm listening. Verry attentively.

01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:36.518
And eh he started to hit me, but I didn't scream. And the, the boys, you know, couldn't understand,

01:40:36.518 --> 01:40:43.982
I don't know how many, I never counted, it could have been ten or more, but each time the whip

01:40:43.982 --> 01:40:51.601
came along to the front I had blisters on my stomach. And then he told to the guy, guard, take her

01:40:51.601 --> 01:40:59.610
back to the laundry and the girls wanted to help me and cold compresses, I couldn't sit, I couldn't

01:40:59.610 --> 01:41:07.074
lie and my head was nearly bursting. And we had a nurse from  Czechoslovakia, a man, if somebody

01:41:07.074 --> 01:41:15.082
just had an accident at work, cut himself, not, not to be sick, because they didn't need sick people,

01:41:15.082 --> 01:41:22.701
that's why I couldn't tell anybody, but that could eh Thomas, was his name, and he said we, we

01:41:22.701 --> 01:41:30.321
had, and the camp we had a dentist. And he said he will talk to the dentist, maybe he'll be able

01:41:30.321 --> 01:41:34.520
to help me. Because my hea it was so terribly painful.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.300
A middle ear infection is horrible!

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:44.352
It's worse than toothache. And, and he talked to the dentist, he said after the rollcall before eh

01:41:44.352 --> 01:41:52.404
before they switched off that we have to be in the baracks and all that, he will try to have a look,

01:41:52.404 --> 01:42:00.618
he might be able if he had the torch, to might be able to pierce through my ear drum.  And he managed.

01:42:00.618 --> 01:42:08.912
He had pieces of cotton wool, everything that had to be so discretely done, so anybody from the inmates

01:42:08.912 --> 01:42:17.045
wouldn't see it because they might talk about it and somebody will hear about it. And that was such

01:42:17.045 --> 01:42:25.500
a relieve. It was running and running and running, you know. But the pressure was gone.  And  it didn't

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:33.392
take long [swallows] I felt a lot better, but I was at the laundry and all day long in the laundry

01:42:33.392 --> 01:42:41.444
with those, with the water, the steam and the, I couldn't  and it happened to have a dream that my

01:42:41.444 --> 01:42:49.577
ma was at home, we had a very big apple tree. And under the apple tree were seats. And like a little,

01:42:49.577 --> 01:42:57.469
you know where we, we could sit in a little, my father made it all, and I was sitting there and my

01:42:57.469 --> 01:43:05.763
mum came home with my two youngest brother from school, they were still in their school uniform because

01:43:05.763 --> 01:43:09.869
the kids at Poland they were wearing knitted  tops,

01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:10.150
Yes.

01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:19.101
uniform, you know, and I complaint that much to my mama said if I won't get any help I won't last

01:43:19.101 --> 01:43:28.052
much longer, could you help me. She said don't worry, I'll send you my sister, she will help you.

01:43:28.052 --> 01:43:37.269
I woke up, I don't know it was next morning or a morning after, I was in the laundry and ScharfÃ¼hrer

01:43:37.269 --> 01:43:46.663
Frenzel came into the landry. And he ask who can sow men shirts?  I said I can only saw collars and cuffs,

01:43:46.663 --> 01:43:55.615
I can't put the shirt together. That's what he need, there's somebody else in the German sewing

01:43:55.615 --> 01:44:04.654
room who can sow the, put the shirt together. He says dry  yourself up so you wouldn't come into the

01:44:04.654 --> 01:44:13.694
sewing room wet  or whatever he explained to me, anyhow, the next morning he came in and he took me to

01:44:13.694 --> 01:44:19.810
the sowing room. Mein dear, dear Selma  that was from hell to heaven.

01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.660
Really?

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:28.449
Because can you imagine to sit in a dry place, near a sewing machine and do things, not just shirts,

01:44:28.449 --> 01:44:35.927
we were doing that many different thing, because the, our, our  eh  lady who was doing all that,

01:44:35.927 --> 01:44:43.405
she was an artist, she looked at something and she can cut it out and make it. We had to do that

01:44:43.405 --> 01:44:50.961
many different things, dressing up dolls, I was doing the beginning the cuffs and the collars and

01:44:50.961 --> 01:44:58.439
not somebody else, we were four in the sowing room, and we would, used to monogram handkerchiefs

01:44:58.439 --> 01:45:03.969
for the, and, and all the lingery for hi, for the, for the Germans. And

01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:07.920
You were working for the Germans

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:15.538
All for the German, that was in the German quarter, not in that place where we were living. That

01:45:15.538 --> 01:45:23.076
was different. And eh after, when the rollcall came on a German was coming, take us out for the

01:45:23.076 --> 01:45:30.694
rollcall, because we were, have to be counted. I didn't have far to go to the, to the, because

01:45:30.694 --> 01:45:38.471
that was only one eh  division, one fence between camp and camp. Not the outside camp, the outside

01:45:38.471 --> 01:45:45.930
fences had three wires for the sec, the third there were mines all around. You can't escape.

01:45:45.930 --> 01:45:54.025
And that wasn't, mines you know, in the middle. And eh  that had helped me that much and I interpret

01:45:54.025 --> 01:45:59.580
that my mother told me she's sending me help. And that was the help.

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:01.590
So the conditions were much, much better in the

01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:03.060
Oh, the sowing

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:04.210
new place?

01:46:04.210 --> 01:46:10.745
the sowing room was so beautiful! Beautiful sowing machines and the materials

01:46:10.745 --> 01:46:17.112
what we were doing and you know sowing, it was su, can you imagine to dress

01:46:17.112 --> 01:46:22.290
up dolls?  Or to monogram hankies? And to s, do lau, lingery?

01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:22.290
That's for the families, yes?

01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:31.610
All where they were going and leave, they used to take that home with them. Yes.  And a lot of

01:46:31.610 --> 01:46:33.230
And did you also sleep there, or did you sleep in

01:46:33.230 --> 01:46:34.160
No, no, no, no.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:34.840
you were

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:40.632
After work, when everybody finished the work from the other places, we used

01:46:40.632 --> 01:46:46.425
to come in to the camp and we were sleeping, that was the rollcall, we were

01:46:46.425 --> 01:46:51.910
counted and then let go to have our evening meal. A little bit of soup.

01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:56.770
So that part of life was not different from the other prisoners?

01:46:56.770 --> 01:47:04.445
No, no. No, not different, but it was lighter for me, that was something that I can't

01:47:04.445 --> 01:47:11.680
explain.  To sit all day and dry stuff and I wi, I never felt hungry there. Never.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.310
Well, you ate the same as the eh, the other inmates.

01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:17.020
Pardon?

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:21.760
You, you, you also used the same kitchen as the other inmates, or did you get extra?

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:27.941
No, no, no, like the other, after work. For instance when the bells were ringing for instance

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:34.057
at five o'clock, we finished in the sowing room and a German took us in where the rollcall

01:47:34.057 --> 01:47:39.840
was and after, you know, we had to be counted, we were together with the other inmates.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.660
But still you were not hungry?

01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:43.910
But

01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:45.850
Because the other's were hungry. That's what you always say.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.142
Yes, ah, but when I was working with the sowing, I was never hungry.

01:47:50.142 --> 01:47:53.740
I didn't feel the hunger. Because I wasn't working so hard.

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:54.520
Oh, exactly!

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:54.700
Yes.

01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.710
So you needed less?

01:47:56.710 --> 01:48:00.070
I needed that, that rest, I would not have survived in the laundry.

01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.250
Yes.

01:48:00.250 --> 01:48:06.826
With all that, that, in my head and all that, I was so worn out I couldn't,

01:48:06.826 --> 01:48:12.976
couldn't survive much longer. And that was the help my mother send me.

01:48:12.976 --> 01:48:17.930
Yes. How would you interpret it? Tell me. A different way.

01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:19.500
That dream, with your mother?

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:26.750
Yes. She told me she was going to se, send my sister to help me. And that was Frenzel.

01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:28.220
You never know about dreams.

01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:28.380
No.

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.090
You never know

01:48:30.090 --> 01:48:30.950
No.

01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:33.020
where they come from.

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:39.980
Where they come from, what they, what they are, what they meant. And all that.

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:39.980
Why you dream.

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:39.980
Yes.

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:39.980
How you make an interpretation

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:39.980
Yes

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:40.210
you never know.

01:48:40.210 --> 01:48:43.450
yes. Yes I, how I interpret it. Yes.

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.470
So I can't answer your question.

01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.860
[laughs]

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:53.010
But eh you all were thinking about escaping. Did you know that Feldhendler was

01:48:53.010 --> 01:49:01.235
Yes we knew, but it was all hush hush. Because us woman, we couldn't help much, it was all about

01:49:01.235 --> 01:49:09.209
the men. And then when, when Pechersky was there and we were waiting that Wagner goes on leave,

01:49:09.209 --> 01:49:17.267
because he would have sniffed it out, and eh the commandant was Reichleitner, Franz Rechleitner,

01:49:17.267 --> 01:49:25.325
he was the commandant, but he didn't have much to do with  very seldom used to see him, and he

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:33.467
was going on leave and somebody else, eh Frenzel took over and another one, that second in charge

01:49:33.467 --> 01:49:41.441
of the commandant was Niemann, but he was always on his horse, he didn't have much, you know,

01:49:41.441 --> 01:49:48.240
the others were more, you know ferocious, but nobody was like Wagner.  And he, he

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:48.810
Because Wagner

01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:49.750
wa, was go

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:50.210
really found out everything.

01:49:50.210 --> 01:49:53.506
he would have sniffed it out straight away. You know,

01:49:53.506 --> 01:49:56.740
we couldn't, couldn't hide anything from Wagner.

01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:59.790
Did he have so many spies or?

01:49:59.790 --> 01:50:06.201
I don't know what he had. Because they were Ukrains a lot, but Ukrains were not in

01:50:06.201 --> 01:50:12.765
the camp, on eh the towers. And arount the camp and all that. Whatever happened to the

01:50:12.765 --> 01:50:19.176
Dutch workers we never knew, we never could find out. They were taking away, I think

01:50:19.176 --> 01:50:25.130
there was a, I don't know exactly, somebody told me there was about seventy.

01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:26.870
Dutch workers?

01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:33.160
Dutch workers just in the camp. They were taking away and we never saw them back or the

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.810
So that they, all at the same time?

01:50:35.090 --> 01:50:39.020
when I was there, yes. Yes.

01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:39.020
Suddenly the Dutch were taken away?

01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:46.844
Yes. Nobody knows where they were taken to another camp, nobody knew why they were taking out, later

01:50:46.844 --> 01:50:54.669
on after the war maybe, the men maybe have sniffed it out where, but utch, us woman, we never had to

01:50:54.669 --> 01:51:02.729
do anything with that. The only thing I'll never forget, when Pechersky, when, when they sniffed out,

01:51:02.729 --> 01:51:10.788
you know, Frenzel first, and that something is happening in camp, when he went in, Bauer,  ScharfÃ¼hrer

01:51:10.788 --> 01:51:18.770
Bauer came back  from the third camp with a truck. And that truck had to be unloaded.  And Frenzel was

01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:26.751
outside to help and to look for wo, for workers, because that was almost finished for work and he went

01:51:26.751 --> 01:51:35.437
in to the office where the telephone was. And the telephonist, that, eh what was his name, the oberscharfÃ¼hrer

01:51:35.437 --> 01:51:40.680
oh gosh, I forgot. Never mind. He was lying under the table. Dead.

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:48.126
And there was a hand of blood on the door, on the door post.  That was eh Engel  and a lot

01:51:48.126 --> 01:51:55.737
of other eh, they were called in to the workshops to try on a coat and they never walked out

01:51:55.737 --> 01:52:03.348
alive. And they, they, they, a lot of other try on shoes, I don't know how many got killed

01:52:03.348 --> 01:52:11.291
like that. Maybe ten, maybe less, maybe more. After the war I found out a lot because I wasn't

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:17.000
there, you know, I wa, I run away to Germany [laughs]. And then, then

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:17.000
But

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:17.180
when

01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:20.500
did you, did you, were you prepared that this was going to

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:29.056
A night before, the men told us if you have spare clothing, put it on, but not that much that it will

01:52:29.056 --> 01:52:37.613
be noticeable for sudden you got big. I still had my coat, I was sleeping on mein coat.  And I put it

01:52:37.613 --> 01:52:46.085
on, and when we, they were coming back from work, that what they have assembled to and I only had to

01:52:46.085 --> 01:52:53.710
come in from the sewing room there, but they weren't, the, here, here was the main gate.

01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:53.710
Hmhm.

01:52:53.710 --> 01:53:02.551
We were living there. The sowing room was there. And they were coming from work to assemble there.  And

01:53:02.551 --> 01:53:11.136
I had to come in to assemble with them. But when they were assembled and that something started with

01:53:11.136 --> 01:53:19.892
eh Frenzel found that eh  dead man under the table and Bauer was, and then the alarm was risen and the

01:53:19.892 --> 01:53:28.734
shooting started from the towers, and Frenzel was shooting and all the others were shooting and  mayhem

01:53:28.734 --> 01:53:37.318
on the camp, we didn't, didn't know where to run, but there were men who had some tools and they

01:53:37.318 --> 01:53:45.988
made some openings in the, in the  in the wire. And I didn't have to walk far to that opening and I

01:53:45.988 --> 01:53:54.916
got out. But [swallows] they were shooting from everywhere. And I wasn't afraid anymore, if I get shot

01:53:54.916 --> 01:54:04.101
that will be a peaceful death that I don't have to go the gaschambers. But I managed to get out. Outside.

01:54:04.101 --> 01:54:13.286
From the camp. And there was a lot of people who were running outside like that, because, oh we couldn't

01:54:13.286 --> 01:54:22.557
march out the main gate, the main gate didn't have any, any mines, mines only around the camp. So that's

01:54:22.557 --> 01:54:31.399
why we couldn't walk out the main gate anymore when the shooting started.  And I still can see myself

01:54:31.399 --> 01:54:40.155
and hear myself in, on top of everything, there were trees, logs I would think, from about a kilometre

01:54:40.155 --> 01:54:48.740
long forest, the trees were cut down and they were lying and we had to jump over them and there were

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:58.011
mines.  Anyhow, it  and Pechersky was near, not near the gate because we couldn't go near, he was standing

01:54:58.011 --> 01:55:06.681
there when ev, everybody tried to get away. And he got everybody for themselves, but he said remember

01:55:06.681 --> 01:55:15.437
if only one survived, to tell the story, our escape is going to be a success. How can you forget that,

01:55:15.437 --> 01:55:17.240
tell me. You can't.

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.820
He was such a strong man huh, clearly?

01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:27.399
We were all strong. And everybody maybe were thinking the same as I was thinking. But I managed to

01:55:27.399 --> 01:55:36.241
get away. And I was running and running and running. But one thing I must tell you. You might believe

01:55:36.241 --> 01:55:44.908
me or not, I stopped for a second and I get a deep breath  and it was so lovely to breath free air.

01:55:44.908 --> 01:55:52.350
Not camp air. And I said I don't care if I get shot.  Really, I didn't care then.

01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:56.580
I understand.

01:55:56.580 --> 01:56:01.223
And when we got to the, the forest  there were two more people there, I

01:56:01.223 --> 01:56:06.063
said where is everbody? And you know who was there?  My cousin Zelda.  And

01:56:06.063 --> 01:56:10.380
the man Simon Rosomovitz from Warsaw.  [sighs] Now, shall we stop?

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:15.130
Yes. I was just suggesting.

01:56:15.690 --> 01:56:17.270
I don't know it where I finished.

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.050
No. I want we, just discussed that we are going to, to

01:56:20.050 --> 01:56:22.010
To the, the

01:56:23.290 --> 01:56:30.950
with the question how  did you escape from Sobibor and become Regina Wojciszyn.

01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:38.270
No eh when I finished was when I just get to the, the, out to the forest.

01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.880
Absolutely.

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:46.944
And there was Zelda there, my late cousin, second cousin and that Simon Rozomovitz from Warsaw. And

01:56:46.944 --> 01:56:55.172
we made ourselve to walked and walked and walked and we couldn't find a way out, but we saw eh like

01:56:55.172 --> 01:57:03.563
eh the farmers, we went there, we knocked at the door and we told him who we we, who we are and he took

01:57:03.563 --> 01:57:12.035
us in, want to give us something to eat and we thanked him very, very much, because we can't eat much,

01:57:12.035 --> 01:57:20.507
but his wife cooked very quickly a potatoesoup and that was allright with us. And we went into his barn,

01:57:20.507 --> 01:57:28.816
you know, before I couldn't remember that word barn, where he had the straw and he dugged out a very

01:57:28.816 --> 01:57:37.207
big hole, so three people will fit in there. And we were all wet because it was raining when we arrived

01:57:37.207 --> 01:57:45.434
there and we took or whatever we could, and he put on top a little pipe so we can have the air coming

01:57:45.434 --> 01:57:53.581
in. And three of us were hiding in the barn, in that big, big mountain of straw. And next morning we

01:57:53.581 --> 01:58:02.297
heard German voices. And the Germans were coming in to look for escapees with pitchforks. But the pitchfork

01:58:02.297 --> 01:58:10.606
didn't reach us. And we stayed there another two days and then [swallows] Zelda said I know somebody

01:58:10.606 --> 01:58:18.753
in Wlodawa. We found out how far from there to Wlodawa, it wasn't too far, we had the secretary of

01:58:18.753 --> 01:58:26.899
the mayor in Wlodawa was our best friend. And, and she said I'll better go because all three of us

01:58:26.899 --> 01:58:35.208
will be too much. She will go and find out for maybe he can make us some papers. We didn't have much

01:58:35.208 --> 01:58:43.436
money, money at all, only Rozumovicz had some Polish money and maybe he had something else, I don't

01:58:43.436 --> 01:58:51.582
know what he has and what he didn't and she left the, the next morning. She went to Wlodawa and we

01:58:51.582 --> 01:59:00.217
never saw her again. We were very worried. And I said to Simon let's go and see where Zelda disappeared.

01:59:00.217 --> 01:59:08.282
I will leave you in the forest and I will go to Wlodawa and find out what happened. And, but we had

01:59:08.282 --> 01:59:16.509
a little bit a incident, you know, going there, it wasn't so easy with the farmer and all that, but

01:59:16.509 --> 01:59:24.656
that I would go in to, to tell about anymore. And I went, left Simon in the forest and I made a good

01:59:24.656 --> 01:59:33.128
mark where he is, because it was a young, young pineforest, forest and he had to lie down, he couldn't

01:59:33.128 --> 01:59:41.193
even stand up there, he couldn't stand up. And I made, made my way to Wlodawa. I went to the main

01:59:41.193 --> 01:59:49.257
road from the forest and I didn't know which way to go, right or left. But a young man was coming

01:59:49.257 --> 01:59:57.485
on the, it was on the road and he was he, he, eh carrying a scythe on it, because it was a farmer's

01:59:57.485 --> 02:00:05.713
son or something. And I ask him would you know which way I have to go to Wlodawa? Where, which way is

02:00:05.713 --> 02:00:13.940
it? He said I'm going that way and I'll show you. But when we were walking, both of us already we

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:22.168
heard from the forest Germans were there, with machine guns and one was even calling out so, so early

02:00:22.168 --> 02:00:30.233
in the morning you  like eh, you know, and didn't answer because I  you know, didn't understand

02:00:30.233 --> 02:00:38.298
or whatever, I know what they were talking. Anyhow when he, when we parted he told me that is where

02:00:38.298 --> 02:00:46.851
you go to, to Wlodawa, to the city. And I walked in there and I didn't know where to turn, I couldn't

02:00:46.851 --> 02:00:54.998
ask anybody where the Golebiowski's  live. And I would, little children were playing hopscotch and

02:00:54.998 --> 02:01:03.225
I just bent down and I said,  would, could, would you know where mister and mrs Golebiowski in Polish

02:01:03.225 --> 02:01:11.372
you know, the, oh he said just the second house there. There was, somebody was always in front of me

02:01:11.372 --> 02:01:16.992
showing me the way. I walked in there and mrs Golebiowski was there.-

02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:24.797
And she said Zelda was here and she left for  his father, and his father has a very big farm outside

02:01:24.797 --> 02:01:33.004
Siedliczcze and we know, I knew him maybe better than the Zelda knew, knew him and [swallows] she left,

02:01:33.004 --> 02:01:41.131
she went there. So she said but before you go outside, she made, gave me something to eat and she made

02:01:41.131 --> 02:01:49.098
a sandwich for Simon, because he is in, in the forest and she said, you know wash yourself and brush

02:01:49.098 --> 02:01:57.225
yourself a little bit so when you walk out, you would look a little bit, you know, clean up your shoes

02:01:57.225 --> 02:02:05.193
and all that. And, and she was very, very kind, but she said even if you go to see my husband, he is

02:02:05.193 --> 02:02:13.080
not that rich and not that with money, oh she gave me some money too, Polish money. Twenty or fifty

02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:21.446
Zloty, I can't remember how much and she said, that's what I like to help you, but my husband won't

02:02:21.446 --> 02:02:29.494
be able to help you much, because he couldn't help Zelda, so maybe our, that was her father-in-law,

02:02:29.494 --> 02:02:37.780
but her husband's father will be able to help you. So I went in and find Simon, so he had the sandwich

02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:45.827
and we start walking and walking and we couldn't find a way out. And you know what Simon said? Have

02:02:45.827 --> 02:02:53.874
you got a belt? I said I haven't got, I've got one, but it's holding my skirt, why did you need

02:02:53.874 --> 02:03:01.762
a belt for? Oh I'm going to hang myself, I can't see a way out. I said if you would put my belt

02:03:01.762 --> 02:03:09.809
on my neck it's allright, but I can't do it myself. So he abandoned that, that  and we walked and

02:03:09.809 --> 02:03:18.096
walked and then of a sudden I said we can't do that anymore at nighttime. Let's walk at day, daytime

02:03:18.096 --> 02:03:26.382
and ask people. If we are found out who knows. Anyhow, we walked and walked and walked and I find myself

02:03:26.382 --> 02:03:34.270
out to a little village not far where  we were living in Siedliczcze, I walked into that farmer and

02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:42.397
I, she recognised me straight away and I knew her very well. And she told me [swallows], I saw certain

02:03:42.397 --> 02:03:50.284
things from my grandmother there, when we were taking away from the ghetto to Staw, all the people,

02:03:50.284 --> 02:03:58.252
she, she ca, mein grandmother went over there and tell us something is going to happen to us too, we

02:03:58.252 --> 02:04:06.299
can't stay there anymore, but if you need something come and get it. And a day after we were taking

02:04:06.299 --> 02:04:14.187
to, to, to Staw, the Germans came and took all the, all, all the sick and all the children out from

02:04:14.187 --> 02:04:22.155
Siedliczcze ghetto. And they execute them on the  in Hebrew it's , in English is the cemetary, the

02:04:22.155 --> 02:04:23.429
Jewish cemetary.

02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.640
Yes.

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:32.149
And that's where mein  where the farmer gave me something and she said that I'm sure it was your

02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:40.828
mother's. And she gave me my mother's nighty. And that nighty I made when I was in the sixth grade

02:04:40.828 --> 02:04:49.252
at school, we learned sowing. And I had that nighty with me till I came to, to Australia and it's

02:04:49.252 --> 02:04:57.676
in the museum now.  The Sydney Jewish museum.  It's not as, as eh it was, but it's still in one

02:04:57.676 --> 02:05:06.355
piece. It was a cotton nighty with lace here and lace about there and lace on the bottom and with ties

02:05:06.355 --> 02:05:14.779
and that's what the farmer gave me. And when I came back [swallows] from the  Golebiowski  Simon,

02:05:14.779 --> 02:05:23.373
I went home to the Golebiowski's home and I left him at the farm and when I came back Simon left me

02:05:23.373 --> 02:05:31.797
a note and he says I will only an eh a mill s, millstone on your neck, you won't survive with me,

02:05:31.797 --> 02:05:40.477
you go your own way and I'll go my own way. And when I got to the Golebiowski's father and he said

02:05:40.477 --> 02:05:48.901
Zelda was here but she left. And he put me up in the, the somewhere where there was a very big, you

02:05:48.901 --> 02:05:57.580
know, he gave me even something to eat and to drink and he gave me an eh, eh light so it would be safe

02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:06.259
on, on straw or hay I was laying and he gave me a book to read. I knew that book because that was made

02:06:06.259 --> 02:06:14.853
out a film in Poland and that Raymond he got the Nobel price for that book. [swallows] And from there

02:06:14.853 --> 02:06:23.362
on I made my way somewhere else, I went to Chelm. And on Chelm I was looking for Ireen, the one, the

02:06:23.362 --> 02:06:32.042
secretary of the Waterboard in  Siedliczcze. She saw me, she said don't go any further, she was with

02:06:32.042 --> 02:06:40.551
another friend and that other friend was dressed up like a nurse from a hospital. And she said where

02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:49.060
are you going? And she talked in Polish, oh she said that's a good friend, that's a friend of my

02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:57.995
mother's friend, something like that, she found something, I said I want to go to Kanie, in the railway

02:06:57.995 --> 02:07:06.419
station I haven't got a ticket, could it, oh she'll buy me a ticket, she even waited when I got

02:07:06.419 --> 02:07:15.693
in the train and she waived to me and she even said don't forget to write. So everything was so camouflaged

02:07:15.693 --> 02:07:24.798
you know, I'm a good, good friend of hers and eh  anyhow, I went to Kanie and there was, and a gentlemen,

02:07:24.798 --> 02:07:33.392
it was almost the, getting dark and eh and  a gentleman was sitting on the seat and I said I know the

02:07:33.392 --> 02:07:42.072
people, but I've never been there, would you know where Alexander eh  Jageluk lives? Oh yes, I'll,

02:07:42.072 --> 02:07:50.666
I go that way, if you walk with me I'll show you his house.  And that was another angel.  He showed

02:07:50.666 --> 02:07:59.260
me where Jageluk lived and I walked in there, mrs Helena she almost clapped when she saw me, she said

02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:07.769
we'll hide you here. You don't have to go anywhere. I said no, Alexander, no Helena you've got

02:08:07.769 --> 02:08:16.959
two daughters and you never know who you enemy is. If they will find me here, you'll all will be executed.

02:08:16.959 --> 02:08:25.553
If only you could get me a ticket to Lublin and I'll go there to the Arbeitsambt and I'll make my

02:08:25.553 --> 02:08:31.680
way out somewhere there. I said I've got a birth, a birth certificate-

02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:37.740
But how had you gotten that? How did you get that birth certificate? You haven't told yet.

02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:45.347
Oh I forgot to tell you. But I, when I was  oh gosh, you see, when I went home  because somebody

02:08:45.347 --> 02:08:53.351
was living in our place, she was eh the, the  mother of, of a policeman with the children and another

02:08:53.351 --> 02:09:01.513
lady came in and I didn't want to stay inside the house, but another lady came in, he, she recognised

02:09:01.513 --> 02:09:09.359
me and we talked a lot. And I was going to sleep at home, but not in the house, but somewhere else.

02:09:09.359 --> 02:09:17.283
There was a lot of buildings there in the back with a lot of stuff in there and eh she said you wait

02:09:17.283 --> 02:09:25.049
here and I'll go and bring you something, but don't leave. She came back with her daughter's

02:09:25.049 --> 02:09:32.816
birth certificate and she put it on the table and she said now read it, you know I don't have to

02:09:32.816 --> 02:09:40.423
tell you who she is, but from now on forget who you were, you are a Polish Catholic girl and you

02:09:40.423 --> 02:09:45.020
were born there and there on that and that street. She was

02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:47.440
Where w, which place were you born?

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:48.380
Lodz

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.160
Okay.

02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:57.426
Eastern Poland, that's where all, all the Poles were escaping from the Ukraine. And I was one

02:09:57.426 --> 02:10:05.431
of them. Anyhow, I took the, the birth certificate and when I got to, to the   I was already

02:10:05.431 --> 02:10:14.219
having something and I told him could, could Alexander get me  a train ticket. Because you couldn't

02:10:14.219 --> 02:10:22.398
travel in Poland then without a pass more than thirty kilometres, but from Kanie to Lublin was

02:10:22.398 --> 02:10:30.403
fiftytwo so I couldn't even buy a ticket. So Alexander went to the station, he bought me a

02:10:30.403 --> 02:10:38.843
ticket to Lublin  and he said: one thing, don't go into Lublin, s, step out one station before.

02:10:38.843 --> 02:10:47.197
And that particular day the train didn't s,  it went in right the main station to Lublin. What

02:10:47.197 --> 02:10:55.463
am I going to do now? There was a lady on the pla, on the train with two little girls and a lot

02:10:55.463 --> 02:11:03.555
of packages. And I didn't look like I'm a escapee anymore because I tidied myself up, you

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:08.080
know, they gave me things with me and all that and I

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:08.670
And you had eaten some ways

02:11:08.670 --> 02:11:15.174
you know, it even, Hel, Helena gave me underware and I had something else and something

02:11:15.174 --> 02:11:21.231
else and, and I looked a little bit better, you know, and then eh  I said to that

02:11:21.231 --> 02:11:26.540
woman you've got two children and that many packages, can I help you?

02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:34.652
She said when we go down, you just stay with mein daughters and I will go to the main gate with my

02:11:34.652 --> 02:11:42.764
papers, she's from Chelm and she's moving to Lublin. And that will be a great help for me. But

02:11:42.764 --> 02:11:50.877
where I was standing with the two girls  I didn't note it straight away, there was a little gate

02:11:50.877 --> 02:11:58.989
and the gate wasn't locked. While she had all her papers with the  the staff near the main gate,

02:11:58.989 --> 02:12:07.350
she nod to me like that, it means everything is allright and then I noticed the gate wasn't locked,

02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:15.463
so I kicked the gate open and walked through with the two girls.  It was another miracle.  I would

02:12:15.463 --> 02:12:23.741
never got through the main gate without a pass, whe, where I was coming from.  So, and I waited when

02:12:23.741 --> 02:12:31.770
she came across and I told her that I'm going to Lublin to  I told her the street, that was the

02:12:31.770 --> 02:12:40.048
main street in Lublin, allee like in Warsaw, near a res,  . And I ask where is the Arbeitsambt here?

02:12:40.048 --> 02:12:48.078
And they showed me a very beautiful building. Lublin wasn't bombed. And I walked up there and I

02:12:48.078 --> 02:12:56.273
was looking for the Arbeitsambt. I couldn't see, but the door was open. And I looked in and there

02:12:56.273 --> 02:13:04.634
was a elderly gentleman in front of a very big desk. And he called me in. And I didn't see the sign

02:13:04.634 --> 02:13:13.492
on the door what it says there. And he asked me what I want. I told him in Polish, he couldn't understand

02:13:13.492 --> 02:13:21.770
me. And then the secretary came in and she was so angry with me, didn't I see the sign? I said no,

02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:29.799
the door was open. And he wanted to know what I want. I said I just want to be a volunteer worker

02:13:29.799 --> 02:13:38.160
to Germany. I came from Eastern Poland and I can't stay there any longer. I'm Polish and I rather

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:46.190
go to Germany as a volunteer worker. And they knew what was happening in Eastern Poland, what the

02:13:46.190 --> 02:13:54.468
Ukrains were doing. Anyhow, he took a p, eh sheet of paper and he wrote something on it, put a stamp

02:13:54.468 --> 02:14:02.746
there and, and signed the stamp. And the girl, and the eh the Polish girl told me go with that paper

02:14:02.746 --> 02:14:11.107
to Krochmalnerstreet and they will fix up everything for your travel to Germany. So I went there with

02:14:11.107 --> 02:14:19.385
that paper and there were two young men sitting there and where, they did read it, where did you get

02:14:19.385 --> 02:14:28.159
that paper, how did you manage? I said hold your horses, it was just in Arbeitsambt. Who is that gentleman

02:14:28.159 --> 02:14:35.775
who signed it? That was the Gau leiter and the  Gauleiter, you know what the Gau leiter is?-

02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:36.950
Yes, sure!

02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:43.550
leiter from, from whole  that  whole not just city, but the whole

02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:44.740
The whole district.

02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:49.913
the whole district of Lublin. Anyhow, do I like to have a cup of tea, do

02:14:49.913 --> 02:14:55.231
I like that, I said no, I just like to sign myself in for a couple of days

02:14:55.231 --> 02:14:59.830
and they will fix up the papers, because I'm going to Germany.

02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:04.900
Did you know anybody in Germany?

02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:12.203
Oh yes, yes I knew, you see, I forgot. When I was at Alexander's place [swallows] Helena

02:15:12.203 --> 02:15:19.344
guide me, she said my niece is already in Frankfurt in Germany, she gave me the address.

02:15:19.344 --> 02:15:26.486
And when I was at the, Lublin at the Arbeitsambt, I showed them the address and that's

02:15:26.486 --> 02:15:33.870
why he wrote out the paper for, for Frankfurt. Allright, I waited eh two days, they brought

02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:41.417
over with a very big ticket and gave me something on the way to eat and that particular eight

02:15:41.417 --> 02:15:48.721
o'clock at night, that was the second of November, I'll board the train to Germany. So

02:15:48.721 --> 02:15:56.025
I had to get first to Warsaw, had to stay I don't know how many hours in the Warsaw, the

02:15:56.025 --> 02:16:01.300
station was so beautiful before the war, but it was all, you know

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:09.033
broke, bomb, broken up, but the train was still running. From Warsaw I had to catch

02:16:09.033 --> 02:16:16.486
a train to Poznan and from Poznan that was eh  eh  what is the place there where

02:16:16.486 --> 02:16:23.940
the border was, in a minute it will come to me, and at the border they will tell

02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:30.089
you what train to catch to German, to Germany. Berlin  in German a

02:16:30.090 --> 02:16:39.339
So I got from Poznan /Polsenheim to Berlin and at Berlin I was getting the train to Germany. And

02:16:39.339 --> 02:16:48.685
when I was already on the train they told me where to sit and eh I had the ticket and I had some,

02:16:48.685 --> 02:16:58.224
whatever they gave me, a bread and jam or something on the way to eat and eh  we got to Berlin. And

02:16:58.224 --> 02:17:07.570
there was a terrible air raid. We had to get out the train to go to a bunker.  And when I got out

02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:17.012
from the bunker instead to go to the train, to go to  I went to a train who was going and I forgot

02:17:17.012 --> 02:17:25.010
this name of the other station, instead to go across to Frankfurt I went like that.

02:17:25.010 --> 02:17:25.010
Hmhm.

02:17:25.010 --> 02:17:33.705
So when I went to that station it stopped, because it was bombed, it was still burning. And how do I

02:17:33.705 --> 02:17:42.661
get to Frankfurt? I couldn't see anybody where I could ask. But there was a young man with a P on his

02:17:42.661 --> 02:17:51.530
arm, he sto, he was standing and talking to a uniformed man and I went over to him to speak in Polish,

02:17:51.530 --> 02:18:00.486
all I have to go to Frankfurt, how, when can I catch a train here? I know I am on the wrong station and

02:18:00.486 --> 02:18:09.441
all that, told him what happened and that uniformed man told him I could understand him, but I didn't

02:18:09.441 --> 02:18:18.137
want to let on and he told him two o'clock at, in the morning a train is, a fast train is going to

02:18:18.137 --> 02:18:27.266
Frankfurt. But when I get into that train not to talk to anybody because that train is nur fÃ¼r Deutsche.

02:18:27.266 --> 02:18:35.962
They couldn't find out that I'm a AuslÃ¤nder. So but he told me if you sit near a window and all

02:18:35.962 --> 02:18:44.657
the windows are camouflaged and pretend that you are tired and asleep and don't talk to anybody. I

02:18:44.657 --> 02:18:54.047
did that. And a lady opposite me, an elderly lady asked me would I like to have coffee she had in a thermos.

02:18:54.047 --> 02:19:02.829
I could say DankeschÃ¶n and I pretend I'm sleeping. And there were eh, they told me there were four

02:19:02.829 --> 02:19:11.524
stations to, to  Frankfurt and if they discover who I am, they will only take you off and put you on

02:19:11.524 --> 02:19:20.307
another train. Not to worry. But I managed to get throught right to Frankfurt. I arrived in Frankfurt

02:19:20.307 --> 02:19:29.176
eleven o'clock, mid day and all the offices are open till twelve. I managed to say in German how can

02:19:29.176 --> 02:19:37.958
I get to the employment office. And they told me on a station, it was a tram station, that number one

02:19:37.958 --> 02:19:46.653
tram will take me to the employment office. I got to the employment officem was about ten minutes to

02:19:46.653 --> 02:19:55.435
twelve, they were closing.  Who speaks Polish and, and, and a German, and a German tra, tram station!

02:19:55.435 --> 02:20:04.304
Oh yes, there was a veteran from the First Worldwar who was from Poland. A German who was from Poland.

02:20:04.304 --> 02:20:13.086
And he said he's going to take me home and his wife will be very happy to see a young person in the

02:20:13.086 --> 02:20:21.868
house because his two sons are at the Eastern front and tomorrow morning he will take me where I have

02:20:21.868 --> 02:20:30.650
the address to that and that place in Frankfurt. But in the meantime he found out that that place was

02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:39.432
bombed and all the workers there was transferred to castle. So he's taking me home, but while I was

02:20:39.432 --> 02:20:48.214
waiting with him, whatever he went to see a friend, he came back with that friend and that friend was

02:20:48.214 --> 02:20:56.996
asking me in, in Polish to me, that other one, could I stay there till Monday? I said I can't speak

02:20:56.996 --> 02:21:05.778
German. Why. There's a four years old boy and there's nobody, they had somebody from the army and

02:21:05.778 --> 02:21:14.473
she has to go back today and they haven't got anybody who will look after the boy. And that people

02:21:14.473 --> 02:21:17.429
had a very big transport business.

02:21:17.430 --> 02:21:24.816
And the wife was the, the, the, the keeper of the office. Nobody had got time to look after that

02:21:24.816 --> 02:21:32.819
little boy. And that little boy come running down the, the steps and grabbed me by the hand, he didn't

02:21:32.819 --> 02:21:40.282
wait for anything, he pulled me up.  And they told me his name is Hans Peter, but he said call me

02:21:40.282 --> 02:21:48.131
Peter. I can't speak German. There was a lot of Polish workers downstairs because he had a transport

02:21:48.131 --> 02:21:56.210
business and they will help me out. And that little boy, because I couldn't speak much and I couldn't

02:21:56.210 --> 02:22:03.597
understand him much, but he was going to teach me German. So he came down to the kitchen and put

02:22:03.597 --> 02:22:10.983
all the utensils he can reach and he told me that's a cup and that's a, that and that is an

02:22:10.983 --> 02:22:18.524
a ma, eh Messer, that is a knife and that's that and that, all the table had the things from the

02:22:18.524 --> 02:22:26.142
kitchen. And then he took me back and I have to remember every one. And if I forget something I had

02:22:26.142 --> 02:22:33.990
to start from the beginning. And you will be surprised, in six weeks I could read, read him his German

02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:41.608
books, children's books.  And he taught me German, he was always with me. Hans Peter was all the,

02:22:41.608 --> 02:22:49.148
mother couldn't even give him a bath and I had to kneel down and teach him in Polish Our Father,

02:22:49.148 --> 02:22:56.535
because I d, I didn't know the German 'Our Father'  I didn't know it then, so he learned

02:22:56.535 --> 02:23:03.999
so quickly the Polish prayers. I had a Polish prayer book, so we used to pray together in Polish.

02:23:03.999 --> 02:23:11.616
He learned [laughs] in Polish a lot of things quicker than I learned it in German. And then we were

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:19.080
friends forever.  That little boy was something, I think every mother would have wished to have a

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:26.467
son like that. He was jewel. He was so clever with everything. He only, even when his mother was

02:23:26.467 --> 02:23:34.546
going somewhere and she didn't remember the address, and Peter was with us the first time he remembered

02:23:34.546 --> 02:23:35.470
where to go.

02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:35.470
You loved him?

02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:38.530
I loved him. Very much.

02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:44.870
Is he still alive?  [louder] Is he still alive?

02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:53.537
Oh, I don't know now, but three years ago he stopped writing. I used to write to him. I even went

02:23:53.537 --> 02:24:02.117
to visit, to visit him after the war, because there was another incident with eh  the people I was

02:24:02.117 --> 02:24:10.697
working for. And that man, he was a very, very good eh, eh German, he belonged to the Nazi, but he

02:24:10.697 --> 02:24:19.627
wasn't a Nazi.  And  when the air raids were over, he builded a, a bunker under the house, a cellar,

02:24:19.627 --> 02:24:28.208
but it was so secure. One day I was running to another, to the Ostbahnhoff bunker and I fell, they

02:24:28.208 --> 02:24:36.875
gave me a bicycle and I was going with that bicycle to the bunker and I went into the rail eh, what

02:24:36.875 --> 02:24:44.230
is it called  from the  the r, r, from the  on the, on the road, the railing for the

02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:44.680
Yes.

02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:51.892
you know, and I fell and people were running over me and I said I'm not going to do that

02:24:51.892 --> 02:24:59.185
anymore, I'm going back home and if that bunker is not strong enough it doesn't matter.

02:24:59.185 --> 02:25:06.317
But I could, take down the radio and I put it on the short waves and we had there Ukrains

02:25:06.317 --> 02:25:13.450
and two Russians and the Frenchmen and two Polish workers, we had plenty and we all could

02:25:13.450 --> 02:25:18.979
listen to different languages, even the German language from the BBC.

02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:19.860
Yes.

02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:26.403
B, but when that was over we had to turn it back to the normal radio and the normal radio

02:25:26.403 --> 02:25:32.874
was always ticking like a clock, that means that the air was free, no air raids and, but

02:25:32.874 --> 02:25:39.344
when air raids were coming they, they were telling where it was coming from. The English

02:25:39.344 --> 02:25:46.035
were bombing at night time and the American at day time.  And I was so glad that the people

02:25:46.035 --> 02:25:52.284
couldn't come down to the cellar, you know, because they wouldn't like that, that

02:25:52.284 --> 02:25:56.770
we put the radio on to listen what was going on in the world.

02:25:56.770 --> 02:26:03.767
But one S, Sunday, the air raid was so quick that we didn't manage to escape, they didn't manage

02:26:03.767 --> 02:26:10.835
to go anywhere and then not far away was a very big brewery on the, there was under a, a little hill,

02:26:10.835 --> 02:26:18.043
a mountain. On top of that mountain was a castle  but there were two Frenchmen who were allowed to stay

02:26:18.043 --> 02:26:25.251
there in that bunker and eh elderly people had eh, eh little eh rooms there, the one who couldn't run

02:26:25.251 --> 02:26:31.199
to a bunker, they were almost living there, because the air raids were day and night.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:40.625
And, and that was lunch time, and, and, and you know, they were going to, on the bicycles to that bunker

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:49.688
and because I wasn't going, Hans Peter didn't want to go. He hung onto my leg if I'm not going

02:26:49.688 --> 02:26:58.751
he's staying at home. Allright, and then it wasn't anymore time to go anywhere. They had to come

02:26:58.751 --> 02:27:07.632
down with all the workers to the, to the home bunker. And that particular Sunday, there was a full

02:27:07.632 --> 02:27:16.786
proof bomb over that brewery.  Twohundred were killed and the two Frenchmen too. If that boy didn't

02:27:16.786 --> 02:27:25.849
hang on to my leg, they would have been killed too.  What did, what, what do you say?  Peshehed yes.

02:27:25.849 --> 02:27:35.003
Anyhow, and from then on they didn't go anywhere. I was only sorry that we couldn't listen to the

02:27:35.003 --> 02:27:44.428
radio. And I was always six o'clock in the morning, I was always going downstairs to clean the office.

02:27:44.428 --> 02:27:53.672
But the first thing was always to switch on the radio. When I was down there six o'clock, I switched

02:27:53.672 --> 02:28:02.554
the radio on and God forbid, it was on the short wave BBC London.  I switched off very quickly and

02:28:02.554 --> 02:28:11.798
then when mister Hillmann, when he came down I closed the door and talked to him  that is only between

02:28:11.798 --> 02:28:20.680
us, I know what you were listening to, but please don't forget to switch it over. Because nobody

02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:29.561
will believe me and I'll get a bullet in my head for that.  And that was between us. Nobody else

02:28:29.561 --> 02:28:38.624
knew about it. And he never forget to switch it over because he was always the last at night time to

02:28:38.624 --> 02:28:42.250
come out from the office. Shall we stop?

02:28:42.250 --> 02:28:45.520
Eh, no I wanted

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.630
No, shall I finish?

02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:48.510
I wanted to ask you one more question.

02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.510
Yes?

02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:51.230
But you, you didn't trust him that much that you told him who you were?

02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:55.260
I did who? Eh, in Germany?

02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:56.230
Yes.

02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:59.356
Even the, the, the man who were working there didn't

02:28:59.356 --> 02:29:02.310
know that I'm not Polish, a Polish Catholic girl.

02:29:02.310 --> 02:29:04.840
You had this secret about the BBC

02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:10.968
Oh no, no, nobody did, the bo, nobody knew, but later on  after

02:29:10.968 --> 02:29:15.870
the war I'll tell you, if you want to hear it now?

02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:16.440
No, I just

02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:17.510
Have you got time?

02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:19.660
we have time, if you have time it's okay.

02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:29.728
Yes. I've got time. And then [swallows] eh one day we were all there in the bunker and eh

02:29:29.728 --> 02:29:39.907
Frankfurt was bombed.  And that place was eh burned down. And they were told they threw down

02:29:39.907 --> 02:29:48.980
leaflets. And they were telling the Frankfurt population to get out from the city.

02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:49.900
Hmhm.

02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:58.366
And nobody was listening.  And they, they, you know, ignored it. And there was, I think the

02:29:58.366 --> 02:30:06.740
19th of March and the 20th of March and the 21st of March they were bombing Frankfurt. And

02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:09.030
It's okay.

02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:16.059
and, and that place, it wasn't bombed, but a phosphor bomb was thrown, was thrown on the house and

02:30:16.059 --> 02:30:22.877
the house burned down while we were downstairs in that bunker. And when we were opening the door,

02:30:22.877 --> 02:30:29.836
the flames were coming down. We couldn't get out for a little while.  And all the, the, the, the,

02:30:29.836 --> 02:30:37.005
the trucks who were in the garages with a lot, it was a weekend, there were a lot with somebody wanted

02:30:37.005 --> 02:30:43.894
to get out from the city, somebody's furniture or somebody other goods and they always organised

02:30:43.894 --> 02:30:50.923
that the, that the, the, the Polish or the Russian or the, or the, the Dutch driver will drive those

02:30:50.923 --> 02:30:58.093
things out to the country because they used to, to, to give them, move because everything was rationed

02:30:58.093 --> 02:31:05.403
so the, the workers used to get a little bit more food, because there was always arranged if it wasn't

02:31:05.403 --> 02:31:12.292
a baker, it was maybe, you know a  eh  butcher or something like that and then get a lot more food

02:31:12.292 --> 02:31:16.580
from them instead of money. And eh  everything was burned up.

02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:27.190
And the, he, he had horses but the horses managed to get out from the barns. And later on they built

02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:38.225
the house back up again and eh, eh was still staying downstairs. But while they were building the house,

02:31:38.225 --> 02:31:48.942
I got and with the boy away to the country because he'll, when he had a sister with a very big farm

02:31:48.942 --> 02:31:59.340
and I was looking for the boy in the, in the country, from time to time they used to bring me over

02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:10.057
to Frankfurt to clean something up and all that, but most of the time I stayed when all that was  you

02:32:10.057 --> 02:32:20.773
know, eh wasn't so bad to be in the country. And then we could hear that the front is coming closer

02:32:20.773 --> 02:32:31.172
and closer. The rumbling  was almost like, like v, aeroplanes over us, but that was artillery from

02:32:31.172 --> 02:32:41.994
far, far away. And everybody was hiding in the cellars because we never knew where it was coming from.

02:32:41.994 --> 02:32:52.605
And one morning everything was so still.  We didn't hear any rumbling anymore. And we got out from

02:32:52.605 --> 02:33:03.109
the cellars  and we couldn't see anything, you couldn't hear any, and everybody was standing in

02:33:03.109 --> 02:33:13.826
the fences of the, the places. And of a sudden we saw a jeep coming and three soldiers on a jeep  the

02:33:13.826 --> 02:33:24.436
one with a machinegun and that was the American army.  That was the 27th of April 1945.  I first saw

02:33:24.436 --> 02:33:29.530
the Americans coming in. The  was signed the 8th

02:33:29.530 --> 02:33:29.960
I know.

02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:32.680
but I saw them first.

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:35.300
What did you feel?

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.024
I felt I don't know there's something else and the American, the soldiers were

02:33:42.024 --> 02:33:47.901
coming out from the jeeps and from other vehicles and giving, there was a lot of

02:33:47.901 --> 02:33:53.851
children and they were giving them chocolates, they were giving them biscuits and

02:33:53.851 --> 02:33:58.480
the children was told never to re, receive anything from the eh

02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.200
From Americans.

02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:05.800
from, not Americans, from the other side, it's got a name, but now I can't think of it.

02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:05.800
Enemy.

02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:13.943
Enemy, yes, thank you. And I had to taste the chocolates and give it to the children and taste. And

02:34:13.943 --> 02:34:21.841
I found somebody from the American soldiers could speak German or Polish, so we could understand

02:34:21.841 --> 02:34:30.067
each other what it was and then, you know, when that happened two or three days later, he came over,

02:34:30.067 --> 02:34:38.046
the father came, mister Hildmann came over to the country and took me and took eh Hans Peter with

02:34:38.046 --> 02:34:44.710
him. And then the Americans were gathering all the displaced persons into a camp.

02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:49.710
But then you told the father that you were who you were?

02:34:49.710 --> 02:34:50.350
Then, when that

02:34:50.350 --> 02:34:51.910
How did you tell? What happened?

02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:58.497
He, I told him who I am and how I am, but, and all that. He said he knew what

02:34:58.497 --> 02:35:04.913
was happening in concentration camps, but he actually was a paying Nazi. He

02:35:04.913 --> 02:35:10.560
knew it was wrong, but what could he, but what could he have done?

02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:10.740
Hmhm.

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:18.820
Tell me. But he was so good for the workers. I don't think s, you could find, but then after

02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:27.072
the war, when I was already living in the, in displaced persons camp, I got a call from American

02:35:27.072 --> 02:35:34.981
to come to Frankfurt. So I hopped on the train and got to Frankfurt. Frankfurt had eh one eh

02:35:34.981 --> 02:35:42.803
suburb. It was called the  Anlage. Three tall buildings only, but they were, the walls were

02:35:42.803 --> 02:35:50.626
camouflaged, painted trees, the Americans didn't bomb, bomb that, because it was a little

02:35:50.626 --> 02:35:58.363
forest. But that was the American headquarters in Frankfurt. And mister Hildmannwas called

02:35:58.363 --> 02:36:06.443
to the Americans and all the other workers was called over to tell how mister Hillmann behaved

02:36:06.443 --> 02:36:14.523
during the war. And I only could tell everything good and I told them the way he was listening

02:36:14.523 --> 02:36:19.079
to the ABC and only two of us knew about it. [laughs]

02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:20.200
Listen, I think we have to stop

02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:20.200
Yes.

02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:20.400
because you are, your story is deteriorating, so I think

02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:25.590
And then I was taken back to Frankfurt.

02:36:27.490 --> 02:36:28.980
We ended with you

02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:30.690
But I skipped something.

02:36:30.690 --> 02:36:31.420
What did you skip?

02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:34.900
Before that.

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:34.900
Yes?

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:34.900
When I met my husband

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:34.900
Yes.

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:35.650
during the war.

02:36:35.650 --> 02:36:36.180
Yes?

02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:37.900
Can I go back for  then?

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:39.090
Yes. Please.

02:36:39.090 --> 02:36:43.300
That was in, in summer '44.

02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:43.300
Yes?

02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:51.043
Or was it, yes I think it was still summer then. And eh I was working upstairs in, in the rooms

02:36:51.043 --> 02:36:58.867
and of a sudden when I looked out the window there were two Polish soldiers. On, on, downstairs,

02:36:58.867 --> 02:37:06.448
talking with a German soldier and talking to Mr. Hildmann and they were from the prisoners of

02:37:06.448 --> 02:37:14.272
war outside Frankfurt, they were a lot, there's an  that was an officers prisoners of war from

02:37:14.272 --> 02:37:22.097
Poland. And I run down because I've never seen a Polish soldier in Germany and I start talking

02:37:22.097 --> 02:37:30.330
to them in Polish and they were just, you know, my husband could, spoke very well German, it wasn't

02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:37.991
my husband then, but that soldier could speak very well German and they intro, they introduced

02:37:37.991 --> 02:37:45.816
themselves to me. And, and eh I was so amazed, you know, I was so happy when I saw them and then

02:37:45.816 --> 02:37:50.870
they was taking from there for the camp, eh cole and potatoes.

02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:51.980
Yes?

02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:59.232
And the German soldier took them back outside where that all was and I didn't see

02:37:59.232 --> 02:38:06.397
them anymore. And then when the, after the war, when the Americans were collecting

02:38:06.397 --> 02:38:13.912
all the displaced person in Frankfurt and we were put in, there was a  a street, there

02:38:13.912 --> 02:38:21.339
were nothing but little, not cottages but it was connected a lot of little eh  house,

02:38:21.339 --> 02:38:26.670
hou, not houses, but like we have here, what is it called, eh

02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:27.250
Bungalows?

02:38:27.250 --> 02:38:36.361
yes, and, and  and we were up to, the women, single women and the women with children were on those places

02:38:36.361 --> 02:38:45.043
upstairs and I was upstairs with them and the others were somewhere downstairs and when I looked down

02:38:45.043 --> 02:38:52.780
on, and  downstairs at the, the yard down there, there were the two Polish soldiers there.

02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:52.960
Again?

02:38:52.960 --> 02:39:00.651
Again. And there were more Polish soldiers there because they took all the displaced

02:39:00.651 --> 02:39:08.892
persons, even if they were displaced, or displaced persons, you know, eh, as, as militaire

02:39:08.892 --> 02:39:16.674
there, there were all taking away and they were put in those places where we were and

02:39:16.674 --> 02:39:24.732
we didn't stay very long in there, and they took us away to a very, very big  a German

02:39:24.732 --> 02:39:29.860
eh Luftwaffekazerne, that would be in English eh, eh Luf

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:30.520
Air, airforce kazerne.

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:39.087
air, airforce, they were very, very big places, three, three story high places and that was in Wetzlar,

02:39:39.087 --> 02:39:47.072
it wasn't in Frankfurt, it was a little bit away from, and that's where we were allocated in

02:39:47.072 --> 02:39:55.556
there. And then there were the  the s, the, the  displaced persons, per, person and even the prisoners

02:39:55.556 --> 02:40:03.542
of war were there too. There, I don't know how many thousand of people they situated there, it

02:40:03.542 --> 02:40:10.030
was not only from Polish people or whatever, were all in that camp in Wetzlar.

02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:12.040
How were conditions there?

02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:19.753
The conditions was allright, because the American was feeding us, where the food was coming

02:40:19.753 --> 02:40:27.552
from, they were clothing us, there were very big ships were coming from everywhere and there

02:40:27.552 --> 02:40:35.519
was eh so organised that, that they took from the camp people who wanted to work.  And eh, you

02:40:35.519 --> 02:40:43.403
know, then I went, wanted to work there, so they put me in the clothing eh magazine and I was

02:40:43.403 --> 02:40:51.710
helping out people with, with whatever they needed clothes. And one day eh somebody in an uniform,

02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:59.677
a Polish uniform, come in, came in and he was looking for socks and a football.  And we looked

02:40:59.677 --> 02:41:07.815
at him, there were other people, but we had our people who was organising that was from Holland,

02:41:07.815 --> 02:41:15.529
that was Mary van Wessum, she was a militair eh, eh  I don't remember the ranks, but they

02:41:15.529 --> 02:41:23.666
were all, all from the mil, militair. And we had the, the  the, mein person who was loo, looking

02:41:23.666 --> 02:41:27.819
after that big, big camp, was an English general.

02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:35.888
And his name was Watkins. But he had other militair under him, not English for, but Dutch people. A

02:41:35.888 --> 02:41:44.445
lot of Dut, and, but all in uniforms. And they were looking for the people in camps, they were organising

02:41:44.445 --> 02:41:52.432
straight away with different countries, for different, you know that, they, they were not lost, we

02:41:52.432 --> 02:42:00.582
had all the Polish, Polish and, and a lot of them, you know, with the Polish people they could speak

02:42:00.582 --> 02:42:08.568
English to them and they were organising us, I remember the one who was looking after the food for

02:42:08.568 --> 02:42:16.555
us was from Danzigand as soon I was a, a Gdansk, or Danzig, Danzig was the  name and, and a lot, a

02:42:16.555 --> 02:42:25.031
lot of people, you know, and I just, like I said, I volunteer for work and I was taking to that magazine

02:42:25.031 --> 02:42:33.262
where the clothing were and I have even got in then the book, there is a, a picture, where I was, you

02:42:33.262 --> 02:42:41.249
know, working. And that particular person, we've tried to find for him socks and a ball and then

02:42:41.249 --> 02:42:49.643
he found some shirts and he [swallows] had a Polish polonja, he put a Polish, eh  soccer team together.

02:42:49.643 --> 02:42:58.119
And then  the soc, the Polish people were taking away to another camp  and we, there were people coming

02:42:58.119 --> 02:43:06.187
from Russia and from allover other places and they were Jewish people. And I was amongst them.  But

02:43:06.187 --> 02:43:14.581
now I have to go back, if you would be so kind to switch it off for a little, I have to organise myself

02:43:14.581 --> 02:43:22.813
how to start talking about it. Because in the, just now I've got a little bit a mixture in my head.

02:43:22.813 --> 02:43:25.910
I don't know what comes first. Can I

02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:27.730
Okay, but

02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:28.790
can I, can I

02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:31.660
you can, you can just start and I'll try to help you.

02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:39.437
Yes. I, I eh met that eh man again who organised the polonja first and he was starting, you

02:43:39.437 --> 02:43:47.556
know, want to know where I'm from, because I helped him out a lot from that clothing magazine

02:43:47.556 --> 02:43:54.650
for, for the, the, the football, eh, you know and my husband, he was the coach. And

02:43:54.650 --> 02:43:58.000
And it was the same man as you had seen before?

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.430
yes, with that, what I met in, in Frankfurt during the war.

02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:03.230
Yes.

02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:10.660
And I met him later on and he came in to get the football stuff that was always the same man. Even one

02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:18.237
day I thought that he was stealing something, he found eh, eh ball or a football and he put it un, under

02:44:18.237 --> 02:44:26.032
his jacket and I asked what have you got something here, what are you taking? And he said I'm not taking,

02:44:26.032 --> 02:44:33.318
I was just keeping so it wouldn't get lost, something like that. And it was so lovely, we spoke in

02:44:33.318 --> 02:44:40.748
Polish and I asked where he was from and he wanted to know where I was from and on the beginning I was

02:44:40.748 --> 02:44:48.252
a Polish Catholic girl and he was a Catholic man who was born in, in south, in eh Ost Pruisen, that was

02:44:48.252 --> 02:44:55.683
not far from Danzig and he was working in Gdansk, in Danzig, and all that. And I found out that he was

02:44:55.683 --> 02:45:03.333
a eh journalist. You know, and all that. And then that went on a little bit further and further, he never

02:45:03.333 --> 02:45:10.764
left me alone and I don't left him alone. And of a sudden he proposed would I like to marry him. And

02:45:10.764 --> 02:45:18.049
it was a little bit, you know, I was only twenty then, I though I am a little bit too young and, you

02:45:18.049 --> 02:45:25.625
know, but he was a lot older than I was. And I, I thought myself, I saw him more as a father person than

02:45:25.625 --> 02:45:29.560
a husband. Not that old, but he, for his age he looked

02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:30.430
Much older.

02:45:30.430 --> 02:45:37.093
ve, very yo, young and mature and all that and maybe that uniform attracted me that much, but in

02:45:37.093 --> 02:45:43.687
the meantime, when all that was happening the Polish people were take, there was something else

02:45:43.687 --> 02:45:50.629
in that Wetzlar camp, there was a lot of Russian peo, people who didn't want to go back to Russia.

02:45:50.629 --> 02:45:57.223
But the Russians were then, you know, with the American and  they were allies and they could do

02:45:57.223 --> 02:46:03.817
whatever they want, so they collect all the people who were from Russia, but the woman tried to

02:46:03.817 --> 02:46:10.620
escape, you wouldn't believe what they did to their own women. They shaved their heads.  So they

02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:15.410
couldn't escape from that part of Wetzlar  camp, where the Russians

02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:16.160
You  to the women?

02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:21.062
Yes, the Russian, the communist, the regime, the communist regime did that

02:46:21.062 --> 02:46:26.164
to them, because they didn't want to go back to Russia. They wanted to stay

02:46:26.164 --> 02:46:30.670
in German or go somewhere else or meet other people. And eh later on

02:46:30.670 --> 02:46:32.400
Were those Jewish women?

02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:36.370
Not yet, not yet, maybe they were but we didn't hear about it.

02:46:36.370 --> 02:46:36.600
Yes.

02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:44.564
But then there was a lot of that was transferred somewhere else and a lot of Jewish people were

02:46:44.564 --> 02:46:52.361
starting to come from all over.  Mostly from Russia. I didn't know if they were all Jewish,

02:46:52.361 --> 02:47:00.326
but a lot, a lot of people, you know we had eh, eh  I don't know how to, to explain. From all

02:47:00.326 --> 02:47:08.206
nominations, but it was so hard for me to accept the Russian Jews. Because we never, I don't

02:47:08.206 --> 02:47:16.087
know, because they were so hungry of things, they w, once there even said, maybe I shouldn't

02:47:16.087 --> 02:47:22.039
say that, they would have stepped over corpses to get what they wanted.

02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:22.040
They had suffered so much.

02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:22.040
Pardon?

02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:22.390
They had suffered so much?

02:47:22.390 --> 02:47:30.658
The, the camp had everything but it was never enough. And they were, they let them in because they

02:47:30.658 --> 02:47:38.588
promised they will go to Palestine. And they never did. They were going, running away whatever

02:47:38.588 --> 02:47:46.941
they could, but they tried to get everything they could, even sometimes the Germans was complaining

02:47:46.941 --> 02:47:55.040
that they had got somebody was stealing the, the, the, eh  chicken or stealing eh  whatever, you

02:47:55.040 --> 02:48:02.971
know and the Americans had enough for us to feed us and give  us, they didn't have to do it.

02:48:02.971 --> 02:48:10.986
But for the Russian migrants it was never enough. And that's what I, even, I shouldn't say,

02:48:10.986 --> 02:48:19.001
because we are all migrants there, but eh I didn't like them, what, whatever they were doing,

02:48:19.001 --> 02:48:27.269
you know. But for me it was something like  a family came back from Russia. And I recognised them.

02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:32.499
And they were eh, they had the oil, oil factory in Siedliczcze

02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:32.830
Hmhm.

02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:37.520
and one of the daughters was in the same class as my sister

02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:38.190
Hmhm.

02:48:38.190 --> 02:48:45.203
and we started to talk and she even brought out a album, even from the school and

02:48:45.203 --> 02:48:52.216
from a school photo where my sister was only seven then, just started school, she

02:48:52.216 --> 02:48:59.316
cut out [scrapes throat], pardon me, [scrapes throat] my sister's photo and that

02:48:59.316 --> 02:49:05.810
was the only photo I've got from home when my sister was seven years old.

02:49:05.810 --> 02:49:06.500
It's in the book, yes.

02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:14.947
It's in the book. And I was really, really happy about it. I, I enlarged it, you know, later on, I

02:49:14.947 --> 02:49:23.648
got somebody who did it for me and it's a normal picture. And there was a lot, a lot of Jewish people

02:49:23.648 --> 02:49:32.095
in that camp then and there was trying a lot, a lot, was registered to go to Palestine, a lot to the

02:49:32.095 --> 02:49:40.965
United States and to you name it. And  I didn't know where I belong to, I was almost ready, but before,

02:49:40.965 --> 02:49:49.497
because I was working I was allowed to live outside the camp. So I was living privately. And everyday

02:49:49.497 --> 02:49:57.945
I was going into the camp for work and while I was getting ready to go to Poland, because there were

02:49:57.945 --> 02:50:06.392
a lot of people were registered to go back to their own countries, like to, to, to, to, you name it,

02:50:06.392 --> 02:50:14.839
even a lot to Poland and I wanted to go back to Poland. And that was a Saturday and somebody knocked

02:50:14.839 --> 02:50:23.371
at mein door and Henrich Kupper, Kuperscki came along, but that was Zelda's cousin, he was a little

02:50:23.371 --> 02:50:31.819
bit connected, but far away, I couldn't call him that he was my cousin, but I recognised him, even

02:50:31.819 --> 02:50:40.351
he was only about fifteen when I saw him and of a sudden he was nineteen, but he had a string of grey

02:50:40.351 --> 02:50:48.967
hair on his head and I said what happened to, you know, he started to explain where he was working and

02:50:48.967 --> 02:50:58.175
he, he survived and all that. And he said that he  had got greetings from Zelda. Zelda eh is in eh Stuttgart.

02:50:58.175 --> 02:51:06.707
And she eh found her, her uncles in America and she was going to the United States.  And then she was

02:51:06.707 --> 02:51:15.492
outside and then slowly he told me that I brought back Zelda with me so she came in. Because he didn't

02:51:15.492 --> 02:51:24.447
want to shock me that she's alive. And from there on she wanted me to go back with her to, to Stuttgart,

02:51:24.447 --> 02:51:33.063
eh but my husband was a little bit, not to agree, but he said once I leave I'll never come back. But

02:51:33.063 --> 02:51:41.510
I couldn't go to the United States because I had to wait for somebody who will sponsor us  and she

02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:50.127
had somebody, she, she had uncles then in the United State, and one of the uncles adopted her. Because

02:51:50.127 --> 02:51:51.310
the same Metz.

02:51:51.310 --> 02:51:52.010
Hmhm.

02:51:52.010 --> 02:51:58.479
And the same surname. Anyhow, she left. And v, eh  I think it was

02:51:58.479 --> 02:52:04.750
May or, or June '46, she left to the United States.  And, and

02:52:04.750 --> 02:52:04.910
Were you already  married?

02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:04.910
I was ma, oh yes, I was married, oh

02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:04.910
When did you marry?

02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:06.380
I forgot to tell. I

02:52:06.380 --> 02:52:08.360
Yes, that's, I promised you to help you.

02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:11.990
married the 24th of December 1945, Christmas

02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.710
So you said

02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.880
eve.

02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:15.760
you had said yes when he proposed.

02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:16.950
When he proposed, yes.

02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:20.010
Because you liked him?

02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:28.876
I liked him, yes, very much, yes. I loved him very much, he loved me. Oh he was, not, not just loved

02:52:28.876 --> 02:52:36.605
me, that, but he was jalous of ev, every [laughs] person who came along and one day even there was

02:52:36.605 --> 02:52:44.412
a ball and then a Polish officer, he was twice as tall as I am, he came along to ask me for a dance

02:52:44.412 --> 02:52:52.220
and I remember that my nose was just on his eh buckle of his, of his belt [laughs] from the uniform

02:52:52.220 --> 02:53:00.186
and all that. [laughs] Anyhow, we had to wait, we were registered to go to the United States, because

02:53:00.186 --> 02:53:07.835
other friends went along to the United States and they promised they will help us to get out from

02:53:07.835 --> 02:53:15.407
Germany. But it took a little bit too long to find an America sponsor to get a couple out and in

02:53:15.407 --> 02:53:23.372
the meantime  Andrew was born, the, the, the 4th of February '47  and not long after, a year after,

02:53:23.372 --> 02:53:27.710
you know, I was so very sick. The operation started too

02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:29.960
Wait, wait, you're going too fast now.

02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:38.588
I'm going too fast again. Anyhow, we, we couldn't, we stayed there privately where we were living

02:53:38.588 --> 02:53:47.643
and eh my husband was with the Jewish community in the camp, he was with the Andra, the united restitution

02:53:47.643 --> 02:53:56.271
organisation, you know, and he was eh with other people, in the meantime my husband found his brother

02:53:56.271 --> 02:54:04.558
and his brother was in the English zone, because the, that was where the English was fighting the

02:54:04.558 --> 02:54:13.357
German and he was with the Polish army there. So he came over and he had, had already married a Russian

02:54:13.357 --> 02:54:21.729
woman, but she had pe, papers made out that she's Polish, she spoke very well Polish and she was

02:54:21.729 --> 02:54:30.015
a midwife. She had documents as a doctor from Russia and eh  the brother came over and he settled

02:54:30.015 --> 02:54:38.387
a little while with us, but he wanted very badly to go back to Poland. So in about a year's time

02:54:38.387 --> 02:54:46.588
they already had a lit, a girl and we helped him a lot out, you know, from the Russian zone, not

02:54:46.588 --> 02:54:55.046
Rus, the American zone, we had everything to help them while we were working and all that, and then

02:54:55.046 --> 02:55:03.418
my husband found his eh, a general was looking for the Polish prisoners of war who was in there in

02:55:03.418 --> 02:55:11.704
that [and he found mein husband and he belonged to that eh, that he could ask for restitution, so

02:55:11.704 --> 02:55:19.991
we got quite a lot of  dollars, we got dollars paid out. I can't remember how much, six hundred

02:55:19.991 --> 02:55:28.790
or a thousand dollars and that was like money from heaven. But on top of that Zelda was sending parcels

02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:37.162
to Germany throught Charitas and that was something, you know, it was hard to, to, to, to explain,

02:55:37.162 --> 02:55:45.363
and those parcels had everything. When I was short of money there was coffee and even there was,

02:55:45.363 --> 02:55:47.669
and I could sell the coffee

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:48.090
Sure!

02:55:48.090 --> 02:55:58.491
you know, and all that to Ge, the Germans were so for coffee, they would have given you anything

02:55:58.491 --> 02:56:08.242
for it and [swallows] anyhow, I wasn't so, not that I wasn't well, but eh  I had to go

02:56:08.242 --> 02:56:16.260
to Ho, eh bef, and in 1948  I was diagnosed, the kidney wasn't working.

02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:17.190
But let's, let's go back.

02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.870
Go back.

02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:23.590
How did Zelda find you?

02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.490
Oh

02:56:24.490 --> 02:56:25.580
I'll help you [laughs]

02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:33.256
Oh, you are a marvel [laughs], Zelda was hiding in Lvov in Lemberg in Poland. And after the war

02:56:33.256 --> 02:56:40.933
she came home, I don't know when, but when she came home and when she was in Siedliczcze, she

02:56:40.933 --> 02:56:48.691
passed our, I still call our house, that was on, on the street, you know, it was still standing,

02:56:48.691 --> 02:56:56.448
it didn't burn down, and there was a beautiful acacia tree, was already blooming and there was

02:56:56.448 --> 02:57:04.287
a lady standing and watching those and she was so very badly treated,  Zelda told me, to get some

02:57:04.287 --> 02:57:11.883
flowers of the tree and she asked that woman what are you, why are you standing there and, and

02:57:11.883 --> 02:57:19.721
watching the tree? She said I knew that family, I get goosebump when I talk about it, I knew that

02:57:19.721 --> 02:57:27.236
family and one of the daughters [scrapes throat] has survived and one of the daughters are in

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:34.832
Germany. And she told her who I am  and she said that Zelda nearly fainted, she had to hold on

02:57:34.832 --> 02:57:42.671
to her. She gave Zelda the address of Frankfurt, because in the meantime the American were taking

02:57:42.671 --> 02:57:50.267
out all the displaced person from Frankfurt to Wetzlar  and Zelda managed to get away from the

02:57:50.267 --> 02:57:54.549
communist Poland. How she got out from Poland she was

02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:55.220
You really don't know?

02:57:55.220 --> 02:58:02.992
telling, yes, she was acting as a, not as a Polish person, as a, eh  Turkish or, or Greek,

02:58:02.992 --> 02:58:10.420
a Greek girl, she couldn't speak Polish and she had a rugsack, how do you call it eh

02:58:10.420 --> 02:58:11.220
A rugsack, yes.

02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:12.990
yes, yes, and she had a little

02:58:12.990 --> 02:58:13.130
Backpack.

02:58:13.130 --> 02:58:20.560
bit of, backpack, clothing and the, the train was so packed that the poor thing didn't know that,

02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:27.990
that somebody cut her ru, her backpack and took all her clothes out. And when she got to Frankfurt,

02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:35.871
there was nothing in her, in her backpack. Anyhow, she had the address, so she had find the Hildmann's]

02:58:35.871 --> 02:58:43.151
and she went to look for me. But I wasn't there anymore, I was in Wetzlar  and the Hildmann's

02:58:43.151 --> 02:58:50.506
told her where I was, so she came to, to Wetzlar to the camp, the displaced persons camp. And that

02:58:50.506 --> 02:58:57.786
was on a Saturday. And she came to the headoffice. And the headoffice didn't know where to look

02:58:57.786 --> 02:59:04.916
for, but I was registrered in that office, with the Americans, because just exactly the same as

02:59:04.916 --> 02:59:09.119
mein eh Arbeitsbuch for the Germans, the, the other name

02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:10.280
The other name, yes.

02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:18.081
other name, but my mother's name they wanted, the Germans wanted to know, but they told me in

02:59:18.081 --> 02:59:25.964
the camp when we were being registered, don't say that your mother's maiden name is Richter,

02:59:25.964 --> 02:59:34.012
because the, the chef in the, in the  casino, his name was Richter, can't you find another name.

02:59:34.012 --> 02:59:40.500
So I gave mein grandmother's name for my mother. I put it down as Ordinatsky.

02:59:40.500 --> 02:59:41.130
Aha.

02:59:41.130 --> 02:59:49.129
Yes. And Zelda found, because she remembers Ordynacki  name, because that was a grandfa, great grandfather

02:59:49.129 --> 02:59:56.525
and that's how she found me in, in Wetzlar  in the camp. The Americans looked up, you know, the,

02:59:56.525 --> 03:00:04.374
the Woitchiczyn because of the Ordynacki she said that's, that's her. And they gave her, her private

03:00:04.374 --> 03:00:11.845
address in Wetzlar. And then, you know, that's how she found me. And I was ready for Monday to go

03:00:11.845 --> 03:00:17.430
back to Poland. She said go, don't back, you won't find anybody alive.

03:00:17.430 --> 03:00:18.240
She told you?

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:24.576
Yes, from your family or for my family, there's nobody alive, don't go back to Poland,

03:00:24.576 --> 03:00:30.280
stay where you are. And she stayed with me a little while. I was already married.

03:00:30.530 --> 03:00:33.550
Was it a shock to you, to hear there was nobody there?

03:00:34.050 --> 03:00:40.850
Yes. I thought I would find somebody. You see, my youngest brother, if he would have stayed with

03:00:40.850 --> 03:00:48.147
the people that my mother want to leave him, he was a very blond boy and he was only eleven, I remember

03:00:48.147 --> 03:00:55.019
when he was going to school, the boys were last eh, laughed about him because he was so blond and

03:00:55.019 --> 03:01:01.820
they used to call him a [says something in Polish?] that means the pigs head. And one day he was

03:01:01.820 --> 03:01:08.833
going home from school and he went to his father's eh barber, who used to shave him and all that,

03:01:08.833 --> 03:01:15.563
he said my father told me to cut my hair off, completely shave his head. And he came home, that

03:01:15.563 --> 03:01:22.435
was just a school holidays in Ju, June, it was very hot and my mother nearly fainted. He didn't

03:01:22.435 --> 03:01:29.306
have his hair. Why did you do it, because they called me pigs head and, and everybody said if you

03:01:29.306 --> 03:01:33.770
shave the head off, the other hair will be a little bit darker.

03:01:33.770 --> 03:01:34.290
[laughs] Poor boy.

03:01:34.290 --> 03:01:42.487
And that little, that boy, my mother, somebody want to keep him. My brother's very

03:01:42.487 --> 03:01:50.685
bit, b, best friend from school, a family who was called Sadowsky, he said leave him

03:01:50.685 --> 03:01:58.785
with us, he, I can tell that we've got, you know, a grandson from western Poland,

03:01:58.785 --> 03:02:07.374
from Posnan or from there, nobody will question him. But he didn't want to stay there,

03:02:07.374 --> 03:02:13.619
as soon mum left the Sadowsky family, he come running after her.

03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:14.610
He wanted his mother.

03:02:14.610 --> 03:02:15.120
Want his mother.

03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:17.760
But did you know that?

03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:19.280
Oh yes, I was there when

03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:19.460
Yes.

03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:21.590
that, that happened, yes, of course I know that.

03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:24.040
But you still expected to find him?

03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:24.040
spI

03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:27.330
I, I asked you in the beginning

03:02:27.330 --> 03:02:34.680
Yes, yes, I, but I expect to find somebody. Maybe, you know, a, a relative from another place, not,

03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:42.252
not from Siedliczcze, maybe somebody who came back even from Russia or something, I'll find somebody

03:02:42.252 --> 03:02:49.602
there in Siedliczcze, I wanted to go back. And even later on from the United States I got, not from

03:02:49.602 --> 03:02:56.804
the United States, we had friends in Barbados and I was looking through the, the Red Cross, after

03:02:56.804 --> 03:03:03.857
the war, and the English helped a lot with the Red Cross and I, I wrote to Barbados, I didn't

03:03:03.857 --> 03:03:11.133
have the Katz family, but my mother's best friend lived in Barbados. And they helped me to write

03:03:11.133 --> 03:03:18.260
there, because I knew her maiden name and one of the brothers, David Katz, was with her and they

03:03:18.260 --> 03:03:25.387
found him and I got, I've got that letter from Barbados in 1947. I still have got it. And they

03:03:25.387 --> 03:03:32.737
found somebody in the United States, the Red Cross, with the name of Jozef Feldman, and she thought

03:03:32.737 --> 03:03:40.087
that that could be my father. But it wasn't. Because it was somebody else from Siedliczcze, there

03:03:40.087 --> 03:03:47.437
were three families with the same name, with Feldman, so it wasn't my father. And that, you know,

03:03:47.437 --> 03:03:50.630
I was trying so very hard to find somebody.

03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:52.790
That's why you wanted to go back and

03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:53.830
To go back to Poland, yes.

03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:54.870
and then Zelda said

03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:57.810
Zelda said don't, because you'll never get out, there was nobody there left from our family.

03:03:57.810 --> 03:04:02.170
Did it make you depressed?

03:04:02.170 --> 03:04:09.258
I was more than de, depressed, you know, I said  how is it possible to

03:04:09.258 --> 03:04:15.840
survive alone in the world?  To be young.  And, and, and, anyhow.

03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:21.693
Because what you forgot to tell yesterday, is that after liberation

03:04:21.693 --> 03:04:26.310
you had this psychological collapse or nervous breakdown.

03:04:26.310 --> 03:04:29.210
I had, yes, I had the, the, where I was working

03:04:29.210 --> 03:04:29.210
Yes.

03:04:29.210 --> 03:04:37.163
I had that, that night, when tomorrow, I was, had to get ready to go with the Americans to the

03:04:37.163 --> 03:04:45.117
displaced person and I started to cry and I told mister Hildmann who I am, that I  and he told

03:04:45.117 --> 03:04:52.986
me that he knew what was happening to the Jews and I said that I haven't got anybody in the

03:04:52.986 --> 03:05:01.024
world, where shall I turn, I haven't got a name, I haven't got anybody. And I didn't want

03:05:01.024 --> 03:05:08.977
and I, I, I got hys, hys, I don't know, hysterical, but while I was lying in bed and crying,

03:05:08.977 --> 03:05:15.070
that beautiful dog of mine, LÃ¼mpy, came along and he was crying with me

03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.920
Really?

03:05:16.310 --> 03:05:24.257
and, and the workers at eh, downstairs thought that somebody did, did harm me and the Hillmann

03:05:24.257 --> 03:05:32.204
called a doctor and the doctor gave me a pill, something to calm me down, because I was afraid

03:05:32.204 --> 03:05:38.630
to go out in the free world, not to have anybody to look for. You know?  And

03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:43.210
Did you calm down

03:05:43.210 --> 03:05:43.620
Yes.

03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:43.970
that, that

03:05:43.970 --> 03:05:44.470
The, the pill

03:05:44.470 --> 03:05:44.560
anxiety?

03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:48.030
yes, and next day, you know, the Americans, they came in, collect everybody, you know, to a camp.

03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:57.110
But, but I'm talking about you, did you calm down or were you still anxious when

03:05:57.110 --> 03:06:05.764
You know, I calmed down because I stopped  crying and, and hysterical, hysterical cry, you know,

03:06:05.764 --> 03:06:14.149
I couldn't, Hillmann couldn't calm me down, but the doctor did. And next day I was ready,

03:06:14.149 --> 03:06:22.714
ready to leave. And even they gave me, he was very good, she didn't want to give me a blanket

03:06:22.714 --> 03:06:31.278
and a pillow and my clothes and he even gave me some money. He was the best German person under

03:06:31.278 --> 03:06:37.770
the sun, not just for me, for all his, this, workers, they were Dutchmen

03:06:37.770 --> 03:06:45.590
Frenchmen, Polish, Ukrain, all of them, he looked all a, after them, you know, as much as he could.

03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:49.040
But what I'm trying to discuss with you, or to

03:06:49.700 --> 03:06:49.880
Yes?

03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:58.010
ask you about

03:06:58.010 --> 03:06:59.230
Yes, please.

03:06:59.230 --> 03:07:01.560
is, is how yÃ³u were eh, because you had this very serious breakdown

03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:01.560
Yes.

03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:01.660
you married?

03:07:01.660 --> 03:07:01.660
I wasn't married then.

03:07:01.660 --> 03:07:02.650
No, but later you married.

03:07:02.650 --> 03:07:08.350
Later I married, you know. And he helped me a lot. I was

03:07:08.350 --> 03:07:09.320
Can you talk a little bit about

03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:10.130
I was

03:07:10.130 --> 03:07:10.290
how you felt in those

03:07:10.290 --> 03:07:10.290
I, I wasn't alone

03:07:10.290 --> 03:07:11.130
first mo

03:07:11.130 --> 03:07:17.553
because my husband had that many other friends. And you know, I got to know them,

03:07:17.553 --> 03:07:24.214
they got to know me and, you know, really  not just, you know, high ranking friends,

03:07:24.214 --> 03:07:30.637
they were all, if it wasn't an engineer, it was something li, like not eh, even

03:07:30.637 --> 03:07:37.536
doctor, doctor Brondi, he was a doctor from, from Poland and he had another do, doctor,

03:07:37.536 --> 03:07:42.769
doctorate in Germany and I had a growth here on, on mein eh, it eh

03:07:42.770 --> 03:07:43.090
Chin?

03:07:43.090 --> 03:07:50.180
chin, you know and, and even when I was in Germany, little Hans-Peter, when I used to  my face,

03:07:50.180 --> 03:07:57.569
it used to swell up and he used a little, the boy used to come along and said when I grew up I'll

03:07:57.569 --> 03:08:04.660
going to be a doctor and I'll help you. And then after the war, doctor Brondi, he said I'll

03:08:04.660 --> 03:08:12.049
help you with that growth. I was something inside, like a wart, but inside and he cut it out. Later

03:08:12.049 --> 03:08:19.737
on I found out that it was the first thing he did [laughs], practed, was on me.  So they had a daughter

03:08:19.737 --> 03:08:26.902
who was born the same week as Andrew was born and they went away to the United Stated and he, it

03:08:26.902 --> 03:08:33.993
wasn't easy, easy in the United State to be a doctor, because he was only in a hospital as a,

03:08:33.993 --> 03:08:41.084
as a, a nurse, in a, you know, and she had to live somewhere else, not in hospital. But we kept

03:08:41.084 --> 03:08:48.324
all the time, you know, and they wanted so very badly for us to go over to the United States too.

03:08:48.324 --> 03:08:55.489
They tried and then was another eh family, Janosz, Janosz and Maria, not Szikorsky, eh, a little

03:08:55.489 --> 03:09:02.654
bit, another name, and he was an engineer, he got to the United States and they had one boy, the

03:09:02.654 --> 03:09:10.118
s, you know,  the age of Andrew and they wanted so the, the, the  [...] and the Szikorsky's wanted

03:09:10.118 --> 03:09:17.284
so very badly for us to come over, but they didn't have it in time. In the meantime, I don't

03:09:17.284 --> 03:09:21.240
know if I could start [phone ringing] talk about that

03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:21.240
[...]

03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:21.970
There it is.

03:09:21.970 --> 03:09:22.460
Continue.

03:09:22.460 --> 03:09:31.383
While we were waiting that somebody from the United States will be able to get us out from Germany,

03:09:31.383 --> 03:09:40.667
in the meantime they were registration for different countries to go. And South America I didn't want

03:09:40.667 --> 03:09:49.590
to go there, I don't know, we tried but, but we, we didn't want and then somebody, they told us

03:09:49.590 --> 03:09:58.513
from the, Australia. They were from the Australian government looking for mi, migrants if they will

03:09:58.513 --> 03:10:07.707
be good enough to come over to Australia. So we registrate to go to Australia. But we had to go  there

03:10:07.707 --> 03:10:16.811
was a doctor from Australia and somebody else from the government and they had to find out if we are,

03:10:16.811 --> 03:10:25.824
if I am healthy enough, because they know my medical condition, that I had, have got only one kidney

03:10:25.824 --> 03:10:34.837
and I've only got one ear and everything else we had to tell and the doctor from Australia send me

03:10:34.837 --> 03:10:43.941
over to a hospital not far from Wetzlar to Giessen and they will see if I am healthy or strong enough

03:10:43.941 --> 03:10:53.315
to migrate to Australia.  And I went to that hospital for forty eight hours, they didn't feed me much,

03:10:53.315 --> 03:11:02.328
only a piece of toast, in twelve hours or less, but they used to give eh jugs of liters to drink and

03:11:02.328 --> 03:11:11.252
every lit, everything what I was drinking was measured and every drip of water, what I don't know

03:11:11.252 --> 03:11:16.479
how to say it in English, eh what I, I  has, was measured.

03:11:16.480 --> 03:11:16.670
Yes

03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.830
Yes.

03:11:16.830 --> 03:11:17.500
I understand.

03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:17.840
You understand that.

03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:17.980
Yes.

03:11:17.980 --> 03:11:26.809
When it, that, and I was there for forty eight hours and they discharged me and when I got back to

03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:35.818
Giessen nobody came with me, or they gave me something, another slice of toast and something, but eh

03:11:35.818 --> 03:11:45.187
I was anxious to go back and I had to go to the station there and from Giessen to go to Wetzlar  because

03:11:45.187 --> 03:11:54.197
it's a train station and when I arrived to the camp, to where we were living and I opened the door

03:11:54.197 --> 03:12:03.296
and I fainted.  And I fainted because for hunger, that was the first time in my life, I never fainted

03:12:03.296 --> 03:12:12.305
in, in, in Sobibor, but I fainted there. And Andrew was standing on the bed and crying what happened

03:12:12.305 --> 03:12:21.404
to me, because I fell on the floor  and then they had this first to revived me, the doctor came along

03:12:21.404 --> 03:12:30.684
and helped me and they gave me, you know, really, really good food, because while I was on the American

03:12:30.684 --> 03:12:36.180
zone in Wetzlar, because of my condition I used to get double

03:12:37.650 --> 03:12:38.020
Food.

03:12:38.020 --> 03:12:45.687
double food, everything double.  Not that I could it all eat, but I used to get it. And that was really,

03:12:45.687 --> 03:12:53.208
really something, they were so good for us, the American people. It's hard to describe. And then all

03:12:53.208 --> 03:12:59.770
our friends were already gone to Australia and we were still in Wetzlar  and what has hap

03:12:59.770 --> 03:13:01.400
You were waiting for the results?

03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:04.280
for the, for the vi, vi, visa that we will be

03:13:05.210 --> 03:13:06.480
They approved of you?

03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:13.842
Yes, they a, we were waiting for the approval and all the papers that we can go there and then

03:13:13.842 --> 03:13:21.204
we had to have some pictures taken and we had the pictures taken and the pictures got lost and

03:13:21.204 --> 03:13:28.566
we had to get some more pictures taken and we didn't have money to pay for, for the pictures

03:13:28.566 --> 03:13:36.320
and I just eh, eh, a, a package from the United State arrived and, and there was some coffee there,

03:13:36.320 --> 03:13:43.761
so I sold quickly the coffee so I can pay for the, for the pictures, because that was so b, you

03:13:43.761 --> 03:13:51.045
know, very necessary for the Australian government to have our pictures. And And, And, Andrew

03:13:51.045 --> 03:13:58.564
was on the same migration paper with a picture, you can see in there, or, as me and all that and

03:13:58.564 --> 03:14:06.239
then we were assigned to go  from Germany to, via Austria, to Italy. It took quite a while because

03:14:06.239 --> 03:14:13.602
we were accepted, we were so happy, but happy in one way, but another that we couldn't go to

03:14:13.602 --> 03:14:21.355
the United State because all our friends were already there. And here to Australia, all the friends

03:14:21.355 --> 03:14:28.874
later on were already gone to Australia and we were all alone because of me. And  somehow we got

03:14:28.874 --> 03:14:36.550
to Italy and we were one week in a camp there, in Kapua and from Kapua to Sydney and from Senegali

03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:39.839
to, what is that big port in, in Italy? Eh

03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:43.120
Venice? Genova?

03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:47.070
Ge, eh, Ge, not Geneva, no, no, Venice, like, not Venice, eh, anyhow it will come.

03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.890
Genova?

03:14:47.890 --> 03:14:57.988
Yes, it must have been there, anyhow. And on that ship, the ship was called Casablanca and that was

03:14:57.988 --> 03:15:08.597
a prefabricated ship, militair ship. And it was about seven hundred of us on that ship and we were going

03:15:08.597 --> 03:15:18.696
to Australia. While we were going up the steps to the ship, a very loud person called out our name.

03:15:18.696 --> 03:15:29.407
And he was he, holding a very big telegram, you are accepted to go to the United States. One week earlier

03:15:29.407 --> 03:15:37.670
and we would have not come to Australia. We would have gone to the United States.

03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:39.390
Because that was your first choice?

03:15:39.390 --> 03:15:39.440
Yes.

03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:40.540
But Regina

03:15:40.540 --> 03:15:40.790
Yes?

03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:42.870
when did your physical problems start?

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:45.000
In Australia

03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:50.620
No, in, in Germany? I understand it started already in Germany?

03:15:50.620 --> 03:15:58.170
Already in Germany, because I couldn't keep a drop of water in me and it was hurting all the time.

03:15:58.170 --> 03:15:58.950
What was this?

03:15:58.950 --> 03:16:00.500
That was in '47

03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:00.850
Yes?

03:16:00.850 --> 03:16:06.120
because the operation was in '48, the 28th of

03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:08.720
You became ill

03:16:08.720 --> 03:16:09.240
in April.

03:16:09.240 --> 03:16:09.580
suddenly?

03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:18.233
Yes I wa, was ill, not suddenly, slowly I got, and then they discovered with the X-rays, have you ever

03:16:18.233 --> 03:16:27.140
heard how they X-ray the kidney? You know, I was lying on a blen, on a table and, and there was, injected

03:16:27.140 --> 03:16:35.539
me with some dye in my blood and then the X-rays were taking and see if the kidneys are eh working.

03:16:35.539 --> 03:16:42.920
One was working and the other didn't. And they decided that damaged kidney has to go.

03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:42.920
Hmhm.

03:16:43.560 --> 03:16:50.397
And then I was assigned to the hospital about a, a week before, but I can't remember

03:16:50.397 --> 03:16:56.916
the day. I was in hospital a few days and eh, and I was looked after from the oma,

03:16:56.916 --> 03:17:04.230
oma Klepp and my husband and somebody else and I was, while I was waiting for the operation,

03:17:04.230 --> 03:17:10.909
they told me I can go and see a movie. And eh, and  where I was staying in hospital,

03:17:10.909 --> 03:17:15.600
I forgot the name of the place at the hospital, in Giessen.

03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:16.400
Yes.

03:17:16.400 --> 03:17:27.160
And I can go and see a movie and I found a movie where eh it was eh the  Decision eh, eh  oh

03:17:27.460 --> 03:17:28.940
You can say things in

03:17:28.940 --> 03:17:38.433
my, my, f, no, that was an English movie, but with German subtitles, an American movie, that was Gregory

03:17:38.433 --> 03:17:47.926
Peck and he was my favorite. And that was called The Decision.  And on I went to see the movie and after

03:17:47.926 --> 03:17:57.236
that, you know, they decided the 28th of April I will have the operation.  And the kidney was removed.

03:17:57.236 --> 03:18:06.821
And about a week after I had a terrible infection.  And the infection couldn't be helped in the clinic,

03:18:06.821 --> 03:18:16.040
it was a private clinic. Doc, professor Bernhard was doing it. And they had to cut near the cut where

03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:25.351
the kidney was removed, they had to do another cut to release the swelling. I don't know what it was

03:18:25.351 --> 03:18:34.661
for, but without anesthetic. So you can imagine. They gave me a, a  handky amongs, amongst my teeth so

03:18:34.661 --> 03:18:44.337
I wouldn't bite my tongue and they cut it and that didn't help much, but because I was in the American

03:18:44.337 --> 03:18:53.465
section, they applied to the American army for penicillin. The infection can only get through better

03:18:53.465 --> 03:19:02.776
penicillin or something else, another name. And the American army got through to Geneva and I got from

03:19:02.776 --> 03:19:11.995
Switserland streptomicin. Because eh the  no, no, no it was penicillin, streptomicin was later, I got

03:19:11.995 --> 03:19:21.123
the penicillin two o'clock in the afternoon, they told me when I had the first injection because I

03:19:21.123 --> 03:19:25.870
didn't know where I was, I didn't know what they

03:19:25.870 --> 03:19:26.040
You were very ill.

03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:34.053
were doing, because the temperature was so high up.  And the only thing I cried, I screamed

03:19:34.053 --> 03:19:42.419
once and the matron come running, and she asked me why am I sc, sc, screaming. And I said I'm

03:19:42.419 --> 03:19:50.609
lying on a plank of wood on water and I know I can't swing and I can't run because I've

03:19:50.609 --> 03:19:57.390
got a small boy at home. I remember all that, even with the high temperature.

03:19:58.180 --> 03:20:05.911
And that was two o'clock in the afternoon and by eh s  four hours later they

03:20:05.911 --> 03:20:13.742
told me it's already starting to work, because the injections were every four

03:20:13.742 --> 03:20:20.780
hours. After the second injection it opened up and I had eh a little eh

03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:20.960
Drain?

03:20:20.960 --> 03:20:27.814
you know  dripper into a  you know, bowl and it's already started

03:20:27.814 --> 03:20:33.850
to, to clean the infection from inside. And eh  it subsided

03:20:33.850 --> 03:20:37.120
Why didn't they give you any anesthetic? Because they had anesthetic and

03:20:37.300 --> 03:20:40.697
Yes, but that was, I wasn't strong enough on a second

03:20:40.697 --> 03:20:43.600
anesthetic, that was after the first operation.

03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:44.810
Oh, that's the reason?

03:20:44.810 --> 03:20:46.570
Yes, the infection was, if you

03:20:46.570 --> 03:20:47.970
Because they had morfine, they had opium, they had everything.

03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:53.830
They had everything, but I, they couldn't do me, because I wasn't strong enough.

03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:57.910
Do you really want this on the

03:20:57.910 --> 03:20:59.920
No, no, you want to see the cut.

03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:01.100
Okay, yes I see it, yes.

03:21:01.100 --> 03:21:01.280
You see it.

03:21:01.280 --> 03:21:01.720
Yes.

03:21:03.500 --> 03:21:06.580
And there was another cut there, that was the other cut.

03:21:06.580 --> 03:21:07.690
Okay.

03:21:07.690 --> 03:21:08.630
Yes.

03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:10.590
Because it's on film now, you want me to take it off?

03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:14.274
Oh, it doesn't matter, whatever you like, you can cut it out when we get

03:21:14.274 --> 03:21:17.560
home. If you think it's not right, you can do whatever you like.

03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:18.060
No, don't, it's just what you want.

03:21:18.060 --> 03:21:25.553
No, no, I, eh it doesn't matter because, I'll tell you the truth, that is what I went through

03:21:25.553 --> 03:21:32.661
and later on they tried everything, you know, in that clinic to help me out. They were very,

03:21:32.661 --> 03:21:40.231
very good.  And I, I started to recover. But of a sudden they ask, I haven't got mein everything

03:21:40.231 --> 03:21:47.416
I had in the drawer it's gone, why don't I have any mirror? Where is my little mirror for

03:21:47.416 --> 03:21:54.446
the drawer, oh the cleaner must have put it somewhere else, after three months they took me

03:21:54.446 --> 03:22:01.476
to the sh, have a shower. And when I was under the shower with the nurse, and I ask her for

03:22:01.476 --> 03:22:06.730
something, maybe the  eh  now how is a mirror in Germany?  I forgot.

03:22:06.730 --> 03:22:06.730
Spiegel.

03:22:06.730 --> 03:22:18.720
Was haben Sie mit den Spiegel getan? Was habben Sie getan mit die Spiegel in den Badhaus? Oh

03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:30.190
they were cleaning and it br, broke. You know why they did it? I weighed only 74 pound.

03:22:30.190 --> 03:22:31.290
That's not enough.

03:22:31.290 --> 03:22:34.260
And I was so thin, they didn't

03:22:34.260 --> 03:22:34.640
That's not beautiful, yes.

03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:38.250
they, they didn't want me to see myself.

03:22:38.250 --> 03:22:38.440
Aha.

03:22:38.440 --> 03:22:48.470
That's why they didn't have a mirror in the bathroom.  But slowly, slowly  with injections

03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:55.833
But it's amazing that you got a healthy child while you were

03:22:55.833 --> 03:23:01.820
already having only one kidney. When Andrew was born.

03:23:01.820 --> 03:23:03.260
When Marie was born

03:23:03.260 --> 03:23:03.610
Yes.

03:23:03.610 --> 03:23:05.890
when Andrew was born I had both kidneys.

03:23:05.890 --> 03:23:06.570
Yes, but you were not very healthy I guess.

03:23:06.570 --> 03:23:10.279
Not very well, I wasn't very well. But first they saw that

03:23:10.279 --> 03:23:13.370
I am, I've got eh, eh  Blinddarm in Germany, the

03:23:13.370 --> 03:23:15.430
Yes, ein appendicitis

03:23:15.430 --> 03:23:23.195
Appendice, so they, they removed the appendix and then the doctor found out that I'm two months

03:23:23.195 --> 03:23:30.720
pregnant, I didn't even know I was pregnant, you know. Anyhow, I just had my period no more.

03:23:30.720 --> 03:23:33.440
That came back immediately after the war?

03:23:33.440 --> 03:23:40.098
Half to the half time I got eh  and then they send me over because of that, they send

03:23:40.098 --> 03:23:46.836
me over to a big hospital, not then, eh because the, the wound didn't heal. So I was

03:23:46.836 --> 03:23:52.790
five months in hospital and after five months they send me home. I got home.

03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:56.190
When was this?

03:23:56.190 --> 03:23:57.210
In, in, in  Germany.

03:23:57.210 --> 03:23:58.090
Okay.

03:23:58.640 --> 03:24:07.310
They send, you know, I went there in April and I got home in December.  For Christmas.

03:24:07.310 --> 03:24:10.640
Which home? You really got

03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:13.240
Where I was v, living privately, where

03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:13.240
Okay.

03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:17.050
Andrew was, where my husband was and oma was there looking after Andrew. That,

03:24:17.050 --> 03:24:20.470
but he didn't recognise me that I, I am his mother. You know. Anyhow

03:24:20.470 --> 03:24:22.630
So that was the first time you got ill?

03:24:22.630 --> 03:24:31.239
Yes, that was the first time they released me from hospital, but still I had to go [swallows] to

03:24:31.239 --> 03:24:39.938
the eh  the camp hospital every week, every second, it wasn't too far where Andrew was born, to

03:24:39.938 --> 03:24:48.816
chang the dressing because the, the wound wasn't healed completely.  And slowly, slowly it healed

03:24:48.816 --> 03:24:57.335
and, and eh I got double food from the Americans and I was eating very well and everything got,

03:24:57.335 --> 03:25:04.510
got better and better and better and then I was ac, then we, we were accepted in

03:25:04.510 --> 03:25:05.760
I see.

03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:13.851
I didn't tell you when I got married, how it was. I better go back and tell you. My husband said we

03:25:13.851 --> 03:25:21.255
are going to get married in a private, not a private, in a register office. I said allright, but when?

03:25:21.255 --> 03:25:28.587
The 24th of December, Christmas Eve. I said why, can't we wait another day? No, because our friends

03:25:28.587 --> 03:25:36.136
are coming over, but I didn't tell him that that's for after our wedding, only they are coming over,

03:25:36.136 --> 03:25:43.612
come for a Christmas dinner. I said thank you very much, why do you have to keep it a secret? No, they,

03:25:43.612 --> 03:25:51.016
he decided that way. And then at the dinner, it came out that that was a wedding dinner. And they were

03:25:51.016 --> 03:25:58.421
so angry with him, because they didn't bring me any presents and I told him you see how much we lost

03:25:58.421 --> 03:26:03.720
[laughs], he never got eh any presents, but that didn't matter anymore.

03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:04.120
Regina?

03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:04.390
Yes?

03:26:04.390 --> 03:26:07.910
Before we go to the travel to Australia

03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:08.570
Yes?

03:26:09.100 --> 03:26:18.110
you didn't talk about missing your family.

03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:27.901
My dear  there wasn't a day  where I wasn't thinking about them.  My mother, the grandparents

03:26:27.901 --> 03:26:37.087
and my sister  and they, even now,  all my evening prayers and my morning prayers, after I

03:26:37.087 --> 03:26:46.575
pray to God, I pray to them.  Telling them that I haven't forgotten you all. They're still

03:26:46.575 --> 03:26:56.165
with me. You know?  You are always, will be with me.  Yes.  Specially my, my mother and father.

03:26:56.165 --> 03:27:05.250
Father was a very good father, but he, he was looking after us, we never got  for him, but

03:27:05.250 --> 03:27:14.738
that wasn't that, that thing that he would come and hug us, like certain fathers were doing.

03:27:14.738 --> 03:27:24.025
You know, he was looking after us very nicely, but that, that, eh personal touch, he was, we

03:27:24.025 --> 03:27:33.816
used to call him, he was a [says something in Polish] , that means the ev, eh, eh [says something

03:27:33.816 --> 03:27:38.460
in Polish , that, that is bachelors in English

03:27:38.460 --> 03:27:38.460
Everlasting bachelor, bachelor.

03:27:38.460 --> 03:27:39.390
yes, yes, yes.

03:27:39.390 --> 03:27:40.070
Eternal bachelor.

03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:48.391
yes, that, yes, that, that what he was, but my mum was different. She was our friend, she was our

03:27:48.391 --> 03:27:56.799
mother, she was our you name it. If you want to be a m, have a mother like that, that's what she

03:27:56.799 --> 03:28:05.207
was. You know. And my grandmother, she used to come in every Sunday morning and  me and my sister,

03:28:05.207 --> 03:28:13.615
because we had to wash the dishes from Saturday on Sunday morning and she said to my mum, and then

03:28:13.615 --> 03:28:22.451
my mother was very angry with her, let the b girls go, they have to have a little bit of freedom Sunday

03:28:22.451 --> 03:28:30.773
morning. I'll do the dishes.  [laughs] And later on I  grandmother said mum wasn't very happy

03:28:30.773 --> 03:28:39.524
that I do that, but you are coming every Sunday, you are going to do your own thing. You are too young

03:28:39.524 --> 03:28:48.018
to worry about it. [laughs] And things like that. Anyhow, it, it was a very, very closeknit family.

03:28:48.018 --> 03:28:56.597
I can't explain.  And to loose all that  and to left, to be left alone  it wasn't easy, but then

03:28:56.597 --> 03:29:05.262
when Andrew was born  slowly  I got a little bit back, I've got a son.  And then eleven years later

03:29:05.262 --> 03:29:10.410
in Australia my daughter was born.  It's hard to describe.

03:29:10.410 --> 03:29:10.410
Now, before we end this part

03:29:10.410 --> 03:29:10.410
Yes?

03:29:10.410 --> 03:29:13.255
of the interview, there's another thing you forgot to tell.

03:29:13.255 --> 03:29:16.010
I said you told it me several times, I want you to repeat it

03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:17.060
What was it?

03:29:20.370 --> 03:29:28.790
at the s,  the,  when you  with

03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:29.700
the escape

03:29:29.700 --> 03:29:30.890
Yes.

03:29:30.890 --> 03:29:38.670
eh  you got a goal in your life, thinking of Pechersky .

03:29:38.670 --> 03:29:38.890
Yes.

03:29:38.890 --> 03:29:40.450
Can you, can you tell?

03:29:41.560 --> 03:29:50.421
I had a goal, because I was asking myself more than once, even later on, I heard from people,

03:29:50.421 --> 03:29:59.568
but I knew it, I didn't have to ask them because Pechersky words was always with me. There's

03:29:59.568 --> 03:30:08.429
a purpose of your survival. And that purpose is  to do something about it.  Because Pechersky

03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:17.005
said if only one of us survived, the escape is going to be a success. And I knew I'm not

03:30:17.005 --> 03:30:25.771
the only one who survive, but I have to do my bit.  And that was the purpose of my survival,

03:30:25.771 --> 03:30:34.537
to tell the world what they were doing. And what happened there in Sobibor. You know? People

03:30:34.537 --> 03:30:43.208
in other camps had, you know, they were maybe a lot harder than go straighten that, because

03:30:43.208 --> 03:30:51.783
they suffer a lot, but certain people survived the concentration camps. But in that camps

03:30:51.783 --> 03:30:57.310
when transports were coming very seldom somebody survived.

03:30:57.310 --> 03:30:58.640
But you did.

03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:10.760
But I survived.  Then  I had to do what I promised. And what Pechersky told us.

03:31:10.760 --> 03:31:13.840
We have a break.

03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:14.860
Yes.

03:31:14.860 --> 03:31:15.370
And then we do the last bit, which is Australia.

03:31:15.370 --> 03:31:15.870
Yes.

03:31:15.870 --> 03:31:19.060
And we'll have a very good friend of you.

03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:22.520
Do whatever you, you please

03:31:22.520 --> 03:31:24.890
I really try to, to help you as much

03:31:24.890 --> 03:31:24.890
Yes.

03:31:24.890 --> 03:31:25.850
as I can.

03:31:25.850 --> 03:31:26.420
Yes.

03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:27.740
I hope you feel that.

03:31:27.740 --> 03:31:34.490
I, it's very, very rewarding what you are trying to do and what, with how you

03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:40.900
help me. It's very rewarding because I'm not holding anything back, you

03:31:40.900 --> 03:31:40.900
It's on.

03:31:40.900 --> 03:31:40.900
Yes.

03:31:40.900 --> 03:31:48.371
We were starting to talk that you  heard somebody shouting your name, be careful with

03:31:48.371 --> 03:31:55.580
this cord,  so you heard somebody shouting your name that you could go to America.

03:31:55.600 --> 03:31:55.990
Yes.

03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:57.770
But you went to Australia.

03:31:57.770 --> 03:32:06.780
Yes, we were on the  eh  plank, I don't know what you call it, the steps to go onto the ship to

03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:15.882
go to the eh, to Australia. And somebody had, had the  for us that we can go to the United States.

03:32:15.882 --> 03:32:25.636
It was too late.  My cousin Zelda  and some other Polish friends, they arranged it  and they got together

03:32:25.636 --> 03:32:34.924
and they  made it for us and it was too late.  I don't know to be sorry or not, but we were so far

03:32:34.924 --> 03:32:44.120
away here in Australia from Europe for the whole other world, it was so difficult and different and

03:32:44.120 --> 03:32:53.316
there was another thing: we were supposed to go to Melbourne and we have already friends waiting us

03:32:53.316 --> 03:33:02.698
for us in Melbourne. And when the ship arrived to Freemantle, before we were going to Melbourne, they

03:33:02.698 --> 03:33:12.637
were,  to go to Sydney, because a ship before us broke down in Melbourne and they would not, in Freemantle,

03:33:12.637 --> 03:33:21.647
they would not have made it to  to Sydney, so they stayed in Melbourne and we were going to go to

03:33:21.647 --> 03:33:30.657
Sydney. And that was so  bad for us, because we never knew anybody in Sydney. People, the friends

03:33:30.657 --> 03:33:39.852
were waiting at the, the  warff in Melbourne to greet us and couldn't even step down the ship, we

03:33:39.852 --> 03:33:48.955
were devastated but we couldn't do anything else but to, to go to Sydney. And when we arrived in

03:33:48.955 --> 03:33:57.965
Sydney, oh by the way, it was a very, very terrible voyage from Melbourne to Sydney. I think they

03:33:57.965 --> 03:34:07.254
call it the bushtrade that is the most eh  dagerous for ships, we couldn't even step down our, our

03:34:07.254 --> 03:34:16.357
banks. The ship was rolling, everybody was seasick, even in the, in the dining room and the casino

03:34:16.357 --> 03:34:25.553
all the chairs were bolting down and it was such a terrible voyage from Melbourne to Sydney. But we

03:34:25.553 --> 03:34:28.340
arrived in one piece [laughs].

03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:32.810
But before you were there, that was a long, long journey already no doubt.

03:34:32.810 --> 03:34:41.600
It was a long journey, it took, it took exactly with everything, took exactly 28 days, leaving Italy

03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:50.303
and arriving to Sydney. At the 3rd of August 1949, four o'clock in the afternoon we were supposed

03:34:50.303 --> 03:34:59.182
to get down the ship. And we walked down the ship  the first thing I did, I didn't even wait for my

03:34:59.182 --> 03:35:08.061
husband and, and Andrew to come down, I kneeled down and I kissed the ground. Because I was in a free

03:35:08.061 --> 03:35:16.852
country. And we are so far away from Germany and Europe. I was really, really happy.  And from there

03:35:16.852 --> 03:35:25.906
on we were packed up  on a night train  to go to a place, it was called Bathurst that was on the bottom

03:35:25.906 --> 03:35:35.400
of the Blue Mountains. And it was a very cold night journey, August is already like winter time in Australia

03:35:35.400 --> 03:35:44.718
and we arrived on, on the, on the, the train, it was so cold, but I don't know how lucky I was, somebody

03:35:44.718 --> 03:35:53.597
from the American army, he gave me a militair woolen blanket. So I could wrap up Andrew in it. He was

03:35:53.597 --> 03:36:02.300
only two and a half. Because on the ship, before we were boarding Sydney, that was the ch, a lot of

03:36:02.300 --> 03:36:11.091
children had measles and they were taken off the ship to a Sydney hospital, but Andrew wasn't sick

03:36:11.091 --> 03:36:19.882
then. But w, on the way he got sick because it was so cold on the train and I couldn't wait to get

03:36:19.882 --> 03:36:28.585
to Bathurst to, we arrived, all night we were travelling, we arrived at eight o'clock in Bathurst

03:36:28.585 --> 03:36:37.727
eh we were getting off and then the first thing was I had to run and it was too late, because over there

03:36:37.727 --> 03:36:46.782
they were only giving till eight o'clock breakfast and that was after eight. We didn't get anything

03:36:46.782 --> 03:36:55.660
when we arrived there. And, and it wasn't actually the city Br, Bathurst it was a, another camp, it

03:36:55.660 --> 03:37:05.155
was Greater  And the Greater was where the colemine was and there was a very big American militair barracks.

03:37:05.155 --> 03:37:14.649
We were going to stay there. But Andrew was so sick, so I went into the kitchen and asked them to telephone,

03:37:14.649 --> 03:37:23.791
as much as I could speak in English, telephone because mein son was sick, to call a doctor. And a doctor

03:37:23.791 --> 03:37:32.494
came from the hospital and when he saw Andrew he didn't wait anymore for an ambulance, he wrapped

03:37:32.494 --> 03:37:41.373
him up and took him to the hospital. In hospital they just, it was so nice and warm, they dressed him

03:37:41.373 --> 03:37:50.252
in a hospital eh  pyjamas because I didn't have anything like that. Our luggage was still eh on the

03:37:50.252 --> 03:37:58.954
ship or taken off, it was on a box that arrived about three or four days later. And then Andrew was

03:37:58.954 --> 03:38:07.657
in hospital. That same day they discovered that he got measles. And the measles turn out to be with

03:38:07.657 --> 03:38:16.712
something else, with pneumonia and gastro-enteritis. They didn't test him but they were going to give

03:38:16.712 --> 03:38:24.975
him penicelline, they didn't test him if he was allergic and he was allergic to peniceline.-

03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:25.370
Oh my God.

03:38:25.370 --> 03:38:34.029
So you can imagine, he had, his mouth, was nothing but ulcers in his mouth, he couldn't drink, he couldn't

03:38:34.029 --> 03:38:42.059
swallow, only through a straw.  And, anyhow, it took I don't know how many days, they didn't allow

03:38:42.059 --> 03:38:50.088
any mother into hospital, all I used to see him is through a window, but so that Andrew wouldn't see

03:38:50.088 --> 03:38:58.118
me. Because they said the mothers upset the children [laughs]. Anyhow, it took quite a few days and he

03:38:58.118 --> 03:39:06.463
slowly, slowly recovered. Not, it wasn't actual a recovering, but it took, he was six weeks in hospital.

03:39:06.463 --> 03:39:14.571
There's another thing I forgot to tell on the beginning. When we were signed up to come to Australia,

03:39:14.571 --> 03:39:22.443
every man had to signed up for the Australian government for two weeks for work, whatever they were

03:39:22.443 --> 03:39:30.473
put, they had to w, go to work. Nobody was asked the profession, whatever in Australia they were short

03:39:30.473 --> 03:39:38.503
off workers, the migrants were taken there. So my husband was taken to Richmond airf, Australian Royal

03:39:38.503 --> 03:39:46.454
Airforce as a laborer to work there with a lot of other migrants. There were some Polish migrants too

03:39:46.454 --> 03:39:54.798
with him and all that. But that was about a night trip by train from Richmond to Greater to see us, Andrew

03:39:54.798 --> 03:40:03.458
and myself.  Anyhow, after that hospital thing I took him to, we were giving quarters where to live [swallows]

03:40:03.458 --> 03:40:11.330
and it wasn't straight away that my husband was taken away. First they had to, when we arrived to,

03:40:11.330 --> 03:40:19.202
to Greater the whole world was covered in snow. It was so cold and we were coming to a semi tropical

03:40:19.202 --> 03:40:27.626
country, so we had to find out  that they didn't mix up the ships, they took us to another place. Because

03:40:27.626 --> 03:40:36.049
it couldn't be Australia with snow! And you have heard of the snow mountains, [says something in Polish],

03:40:36.049 --> 03:40:44.000
we were just a few steps from it. Anyhow, we were given a, a barrack eh, room and because our name is

03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:52.187
the last letter, Zielinski, so we were giving the last barrack. And that last barrack didn't even have

03:40:52.187 --> 03:41:00.217
a glass in the windows. But we were giving blankets and so my husband had to put on the cover that the

03:41:00.217 --> 03:41:08.325
windows with the blankets, so he asked for a few nails somewhere, I don't know with other men and all

03:41:08.325 --> 03:41:16.276
that and then with other men they tried to make up something to have it a bit warm and they made up a

03:41:16.276 --> 03:41:24.463
potbelly stove. There was enough fuel and that was heating a little bit. And later they came in, workers

03:41:24.463 --> 03:41:32.650
came and fixed it up a little bit. But Andrew was in hospital. I think it took about two weeks that they

03:41:32.650 --> 03:41:41.074
took my husband away for work. I'm not so sure, it could have been less or more. And then every fortnight

03:41:41.074 --> 03:41:49.339
he used to come to greet and to visit us. When he used to leave Richmond Fridaynight, he arrived Saturday

03:41:49.339 --> 03:41:57.527
morning in Greater. And when he was leaving for work back again, he had to leave Saturday night by train

03:41:57.527 --> 03:42:05.556
and he arrived in Richmond Monday morning. That's how the journeys were there. And now when migrants

03:42:05.556 --> 03:42:13.743
came, they have got it so good, they were never separated, we never complained, we were not running away

03:42:13.743 --> 03:42:21.616
you know, what do they call them now? Not migrants, they call them eh  what do they call the people

03:42:21.616 --> 03:42:25.237
coming now from, from the boats and all that?-

03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:28.820
I don't know how they call it in Australia.

03:42:28.820 --> 03:42:36.956
Allright, and eh that word will come to me, but we were not the same. We were choosen migrants and we

03:42:36.956 --> 03:42:45.174
he had to settle down here. For the first two years it wasn't easy. And then after the two years you

03:42:45.174 --> 03:42:53.149
could have found himself another job, but not knowing very well English, he couldn't have his own

03:42:53.149 --> 03:43:01.447
profession. He was a journalist, but he knew French and he knew German and Polish, but he didn't know

03:43:01.447 --> 03:43:09.423
English [laughs]. And that was the biggest joke ever. I couldn't speak much English. Anyhow, I in

03:43:09.423 --> 03:43:17.560
the camp at Greater I find my fel, self a job, Andrew was going to a kindergarten, he was three years

03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:25.938
old then, and there was a lot from other countries in that kindergarten. Sometimes he used to come home,

03:43:25.938 --> 03:43:34.075
that where we were living, he, he  I didn't know sometimes what he was talking to me, he learned it

03:43:34.075 --> 03:43:42.292
from other le, children for other languages. And one day he came home, he said a woman was hanging out

03:43:42.292 --> 03:43:50.671
the washing and she was speaking so loud, he, she said something like that and that was a Russian woman,

03:43:50.671 --> 03:43:58.969
she was swearing and I couldn't tell him what she was saying. I said I didn't understand, I don't

03:43:58.969 --> 03:44:07.186
know Russian [laughs]. And that how it was the beginning. But we were happy and I was working the, the

03:44:07.186 --> 03:44:15.645
hours that Andrew was in the kindergarten, I was helping out the, the local doctor, doctor Lewis, because

03:44:15.645 --> 03:44:23.701
his wife wasn't a very well person. I was really happy she tought me a little bit more English and

03:44:23.701 --> 03:44:31.677
we could learn a little bit of English in the camp. And, and the children were being tought English

03:44:31.677 --> 03:44:40.136
a little bit, but slowly, slowly. But I stayed in that camp for two years.  And there was like two camps.

03:44:40.136 --> 03:44:48.756
One was called the Silver City and one was called the Chocolate City. The Chocolate City had brown barracks

03:44:48.756 --> 03:44:57.054
and we had silver barracks. The Chocolate City had all the administration for all the migrants who were

03:44:57.054 --> 03:45:05.191
coming there. And somehow we managed to survive.  But  we arrived in August, in December I contracted

03:45:05.191 --> 03:45:13.650
a mosquito bite in my chest there, don't know what to call it chest. And that mosquito bite was growing

03:45:13.650 --> 03:45:21.625
and didn't go away. It didn't hurt much, but it was like a little  as big as a pigeon egg  so I

03:45:21.625 --> 03:45:29.601
went to doctor and to hospital. The hospital they tried to find out what it was. First of all I had

03:45:29.601 --> 03:45:37.738
to go through an operation to, to get rid of it. And I had to be in hospital. And nobody was there to

03:45:37.738 --> 03:45:45.875
look after Andrew and Andrew, because the father was so far away and who knows when he will be coming

03:45:45.875 --> 03:45:54.575
and he had to go to a  orphenage.  Anyhow, it was arranged, everything and the, I wasn't long in hospital,

03:45:54.575 --> 03:46:02.793
only three days, I came back and that wound didn't heal.  They tried everything under the sun.  They

03:46:02.793 --> 03:46:10.768
burned it, they cut it again, stitched it up again and the, the stitches came apart, it was getting

03:46:10.768 --> 03:46:18.824
bigger and bigger and the wound didn't heal. They took me with antibiotics, that didn't help and

03:46:18.824 --> 03:46:27.203
then one of the doctors there said we will try a on streptomicine or something, but then in the meantime

03:46:27.203 --> 03:46:35.340
I got better and we had to leave. My husband found a place where to live. It was after the two years.

03:46:35.340 --> 03:46:39.771
And I had a place where to live in a suburb of Sydney.-

03:46:39.610 --> 03:46:47.551
It was called Right, Topright. I had a room, a very beautiful big room and I share with the

03:46:47.551 --> 03:46:55.579
people who rented out that room the kitchen and the laundry and the bathroom. It was lovely.

03:46:55.579 --> 03:47:03.608
And my husband find himself another job. And I just had to go  everyday  to Sydney to get an

03:47:03.608 --> 03:47:11.636
injection. And it was a very big hospital, Crown Street Women's  hospital, that was I know

03:47:11.636 --> 03:47:19.665
the biggest there in Sydney and they found out that I have to have every day an injection of

03:47:19.665 --> 03:47:27.606
streptomicin. Till that wound heals. Because whatever they were doing, it didn't heal. In

03:47:27.606 --> 03:47:35.722
the meantime there was a little hole getting there and the doctor said, doctor Lewis, he said

03:47:35.722 --> 03:47:43.663
you have to be very eh, you know, patient with it because you have to take the streptomicin

03:47:43.663 --> 03:47:48.900
every day, but not interrupt. If you interrupt even two days

03:47:48.900 --> 03:47:50.340
You have to start again.

03:47:50.340 --> 03:48:00.091
it's lost, you have to start again. So I got on that, so the first two years was every day, on the

03:48:00.091 --> 03:48:09.940
weekend a nurse used to come home to give me the injection.  And I found myself a job, sowing, Andrew

03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:19.886
was going already to eh  five years he was old too, to start at school, and I found myself a li, a job

03:48:19.886 --> 03:48:30.320
on the school hours, so I took him to the school and with the bus to work. I was doing sowing, children's

03:48:30.320 --> 03:48:40.559
work, Gayworth in Gladesville. And the nurse used to come to the working place to give me injection every

03:48:40.559 --> 03:48:47.970
day. And I was on those injections home and work for three and a half years.

03:48:47.970 --> 03:48:48.410
Gee!

03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:53.955
Till it healed. And it healed up, it was a very big hole there.  And after I was

03:48:53.955 --> 03:48:59.571
once in hospital where I lived, the doctor said talk to that doctor Lewis because

03:48:59.571 --> 03:49:04.840
he's an English, what do you call the doctors that the skin, skin jobs? Eh

03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:04.840
Dermatologists.

03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:04.840
De eh

03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:04.840
Dermatologists.

03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:13.671
dermatologist, talk to him and he may help you out with

03:49:13.671 --> 03:49:21.540
that hole. Not the dermatologist, no, because the

03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:21.540
Plastic surgeon?

03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:28.380
plastic surgeon, thank you, then the plastic surgeon, the doctor Lewis was an Englishman with

03:49:28.380 --> 03:49:35.294
red hear and he was the best person ever you could talk, he was like a brother, like a father,

03:49:35.294 --> 03:49:42.134
he was such a nice doctor. And he said I'll, I'll fix it up. So he just did two stitches,

03:49:42.134 --> 03:49:49.048
one stitch there and one there and he tied it in a knob, put a piece of, not even as wide as a

03:49:49.048 --> 03:49:56.109
finger, a plastic,  clear plastic and he said that will be taken off in ten days and I'll pull

03:49:56.109 --> 03:50:02.950
the stitches out.  And he put the skin together and he covered the hole.  You can, and I'll

03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:08.540
show it to you later. It's not important now. But you see, that  has grown

03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:15.028
on that side, it's ho, higher than there, but that caused it. And it had a name. It

03:50:15.028 --> 03:50:22.052
was similar like  but it wasn't. It wasn't, it had another name. But to remember medical

03:50:22.052 --> 03:50:28.617
names is not so easy. But it healed up and everything was allright. I didn't have to

03:50:28.617 --> 03:50:35.182
wear blouses and whatever, everything buttoned up here not to show the hole. And eh  I

03:50:35.182 --> 03:50:41.976
was maybe right for a moment. And then  there wasn't a lot, a lot of things after that.

03:50:41.976 --> 03:50:46.710
Can we have a little, a little stop? I have to remind myself.

03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.710
Okay, it's on.

03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:55.946
We got to know a lot of people, migrants, not even migrants, Australian peop, the Australian people

03:50:55.946 --> 03:51:03.782
so, were so very good to us and we never heard a word go back where you come from, they helped even

03:51:03.782 --> 03:51:12.014
with the telephone if I needed a doctor. Mrs. Brian always called the doctor, because I couldn't speak

03:51:12.014 --> 03:51:20.167
very well English. Or once even had the  eh that I couldn't speak, what is it called, eh  that I lost

03:51:20.167 --> 03:51:28.241
my voice [laughs], laryngitis , she used to do all the things and she used to help me out where I used

03:51:28.241 --> 03:51:36.315
to go shopping, to look up the things in the dictionary. I had a Polish-English dictionary to look up,

03:51:36.315 --> 03:51:44.231
because my pronunciation fo, from Polish to English was phonetic and the grocer doesn't understand

03:51:44.231 --> 03:51:52.304
what I was talking to [laughs]. It wasn't very easy. But mine job was to learn English, forget about

03:51:52.304 --> 03:52:00.141
writing, forget about to read the newspapers every day, to listen to the radio every. And I'll eh

03:52:00.141 --> 03:52:08.294
try so hard and I learned it slowly, slowly. I couldn't go to night school because Andrew was little.

03:52:08.294 --> 03:52:16.209
And my husband, after the  eh  the, the,  it was finished, the two years, he found himself a, a job,

03:52:16.209 --> 03:52:20.880
but that was a three, eh  he had morning shift, shift work.

03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:20.880
Yes.

03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:29.633
He had three shift and a, and  twenty four hours, so I couldn't go anywhere. And all the school who

03:52:29.633 --> 03:52:38.213
were learning evening classes English was in the city. And that I had to go by, by train or by bus,

03:52:38.213 --> 03:52:47.486
I couldn't do it.  And it was something, you know, it was hard to describe. But I we, I missed something.

03:52:47.486 --> 03:52:54.420
When the doctor re, recognised what it was that I have to have a injection every

03:52:55.090 --> 03:52:55.240
Day.

03:52:55.240 --> 03:53:03.659
every day  and he assigned me to, I knew a doctor, Polish doctor, eh, eh  how could I forget that?

03:53:03.659 --> 03:53:12.248
Eh in a minute it will come.  And he told me that I have to come after work from where I was working,

03:53:12.248 --> 03:53:21.007
to the city to him and he was in, in a  street, where all the specialists were, for an injection. Later

03:53:21.007 --> 03:53:29.937
on I got the injections from a nurse, because that was assigned differently, I couldn't make it anymore

03:53:29.937 --> 03:53:38.526
to run after work to, to the city. And eh  somehow, you know, I got better. And that was already done

03:53:38.526 --> 03:53:47.115
up, but the other things came along. Different things. Complications with the ear.  The infections in

03:53:47.115 --> 03:53:55.619
the ear. There was a doctor who wanted to heal mine ear. He wanted implant a different dr, drum so I

03:53:55.619 --> 03:54:04.038
could hear, it didn't work. And then it took quite, I don't know how many years before that ear

03:54:04.038 --> 03:54:12.543
was fixed up. I can't hear. On a, that was still, you know, to carry all the things from the camp.

03:54:12.543 --> 03:54:21.132
And there were other things [swallows] beside that and I contracted because of that ear and the noise

03:54:21.132 --> 03:54:26.489
during the war and everything, tinnitis, you know what that is?

03:54:26.490 --> 03:54:27.210
Hmhm.

03:54:27.330 --> 03:54:35.738
And the noise is still with me. Day and night. Sometimes it's louder, sometimes it goes down a little

03:54:35.738 --> 03:54:43.901
bit. But it's always there.  And even if it goes away for a second I wouldn't even know, because

03:54:43.901 --> 03:54:52.064
it never, never leaves me. And that is sometimes, the ear specialist, they couldn't do anything to

03:54:52.064 --> 03:55:00.799
tinnitis. And sometimes you, the doctor  when he goes to Eu, to Eu, to other, eh Europe to, to conferences,

03:55:00.799 --> 03:55:08.799
and I used to ask him have they found out something for tinnitis, he said if we find out something

03:55:08.799 --> 03:55:16.799
for it, I'll be the first to know and he'll be the first to help me. Because it's not a easy

03:55:16.799 --> 03:55:25.288
thing to live with all those things. But I just had to bear with this and all other things, they can't

03:55:25.288 --> 03:55:33.697
do anything. Then  where I was working, not with baby stuff, and they were very good for me, the people

03:55:33.697 --> 03:55:41.860
there. And I got pregnant.  But before that I had two miscarriages. But that one somehow stayed and,

03:55:41.860 --> 03:55:50.105
you know, and I said nothing is going to happen to that, I tried so very hard to, to, to be calm, not

03:55:50.105 --> 03:55:58.105
be calm to, but not do things what I shouldn't do. I didn't even know like with the first one,

03:55:58.105 --> 03:56:02.350
like with Andrew the first half that I was pregnant.

03:56:02.350 --> 03:56:02.350
Yes, you told so.

03:56:02.350 --> 03:56:10.290
But I got to know later. And they thought, you know, when I was in hospital, in  Hospital, that eh,

03:56:10.290 --> 03:56:18.632
eh they, they were trying to X-ray my other kidney [swallows] and they put something on mine eh stomach,

03:56:18.632 --> 03:56:26.493
a piece of lead, and I said what are you putting there? Oh, she said, to protect your baby. I said

03:56:26.493 --> 03:56:34.434
what baby? Don't you know that you are pregnant? I said I'm not pregnant. And they thought what

03:56:34.434 --> 03:56:42.295
would the  we used to be called new Australians, what would Australia know she doesn't even know

03:56:42.295 --> 03:56:50.075
that she's pregnant. But while I was in hospital to check my heart and lungs, not the kidney, I

03:56:50.075 --> 03:56:57.856
had mine periods. And the matron came along  and I didn't bring anything with me and I told her

03:56:57.856 --> 03:57:05.877
I would like to pay from the hospital cantine or whatever they call it, and I told her you see they,

03:57:05.877 --> 03:57:13.898
they found out that I'm almost four months pregnant. And I didn't even know! And now I can prove

03:57:13.898 --> 03:57:21.839
it to you that I didn't know. I wasn't sick, I wasn't vomenting, I was oh, it was no  for me.

03:57:21.839 --> 03:57:29.780
And then  it was the, the 4th, anyhow [laughs] it was funny, we had visitors from another place and

03:57:29.780 --> 03:57:37.881
I went with them to see a movie.  And I, I was on Monday to see the doctor [loud noises of cars going

03:57:37.881 --> 03:57:45.742
by], the gynaecoligist in hospital, in that  Hospital, and he said I see you next Monday. And when

03:57:45.742 --> 03:57:53.763
I came home it was allright I went to see a movie, my husband was then on afternoon shift so he will

03:57:53.763 --> 03:58:02.105
be home at twelve, and we'll come home before twelve, so I wou, wouldn't be late and that particular

03:58:02.105 --> 03:58:03.709
night  [loud noises]

03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:11.050
somebody stopping here, I think I'm getting a parc, I don't

03:58:11.050 --> 03:58:12.540
Okay, the gynaecologist, your appointment with

03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:21.901
A, appointment with him and I said I'm also, see you next Monday because it was only the last month

03:58:21.901 --> 03:58:30.012
of the pregnancy, for the pain, you know, every week.  And when I got home from the pictures at night

03:58:30.012 --> 03:58:38.204
time, I saw him the day time, and I was that long in hospital from morning till the afternoon, because

03:58:38.204 --> 03:58:46.154
there were emergencies in between, and I couldn't sleep. I fell out of bed, our bed was very low,

03:58:46.154 --> 03:58:54.025
with the pillow and I said to my husband I had all, everything ready in a suitcase and I said oh I

03:58:54.025 --> 03:59:02.216
can't sleep, mein back is so aching, I can't even sit or stand. And he said go back to bed, doctor

03:59:02.216 --> 03:59:10.809
Lewis told you to come back next eh, next Monday and all that. I said I, I can't and  about six o'clock

03:59:10.809 --> 03:59:19.161
in the morning I made it, go to the neighbour and to call an ambulance. And that was about six o'clock

03:59:19.161 --> 03:59:27.514
in the morning and he said, you know, my husband said I'm not coming with you in the ambulance because

03:59:27.514 --> 03:59:35.384
you're not going to have the child today. But on the way I got really, really  in labour, labour

03:59:35.384 --> 03:59:43.254
pain. And the, the driver in the ambulance said put something between your teeth or scream as loud

03:59:43.254 --> 03:59:51.446
as you can.  It took twenty minutes from where we were living to  Hospital. When I got to the hospital

03:59:51.446 --> 03:59:59.396
they took me out and when I was in the lift, because the delivery room was on the third floor, when

03:59:59.396 --> 04:00:07.427
I was in the lift my water brea, broke. I came to the hospital seven o'clock and you know, when my

04:00:07.427 --> 04:00:10.560
daughter was born a quarter past seven.

04:00:10.700 --> 04:00:11.970
That's a fast delivery!

04:00:11.970 --> 04:00:20.081
It was so fast and the doctor told me [laughs], we'll you've a dau, you've got a girl or a

04:00:20.081 --> 04:00:28.277
daughter, I can't, and you know, and they gave me an injection, something, you know, I was like

04:00:28.277 --> 04:00:36.389
in a cloud and all that. And I, I remember what I said to the doctor are you sure it's a girl?

04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:44.585
[laughs] And she was really, really, she was not a premature one, she was, you know, really good,

04:00:44.585 --> 04:00:53.288
but she had long hair. And, and really a good looking baby. And after a week, I had to stay in hospital

04:00:53.288 --> 04:01:01.484
a week, I got home  and we were already now, own home, but the home, the place wasn't finished.

04:01:01.484 --> 04:01:09.596
We had to finish it up, we didn't have any carpets in it yet. Anyhow, because it was from week

04:01:09.596 --> 04:01:17.792
to week, the earning, to spend the money, but it was our own place. And Marie was born the 4th of

04:01:17.792 --> 04:01:24.129
April 1958 and that was eleven years after Andrew.  So she's eleven years

04:01:24.130 --> 04:01:24.690
Younger.

04:01:24.690 --> 04:01:34.967
younger.  And now she's not even living closeby. They live in Central Coast, not far from Sydney,

04:01:34.967 --> 04:01:44.830
about eh  hour, an hour drive from Sydney.  And what else can I tell you from, about Australia?

04:01:44.920 --> 04:01:47.580
It's not about Australia, we talk, we can

04:01:47.580 --> 04:01:49.370
We , about my life.

04:01:49.370 --> 04:01:54.170
Yes, well, the trial in Hagen I think, how were you approached?

04:01:54.180 --> 04:02:03.053
How we have, we approached it very well, we build another place, that one wasn't big enough and then

04:02:03.053 --> 04:02:11.926
after a while, you know, I got myself, and Marie was bigger, I got myself a job at home. I was working

04:02:11.926 --> 04:02:20.626
because I stopped doing baby stuff so I got the same baby stuff, the people, the Mr. Jones got me an

04:02:20.626 --> 04:02:29.412
overlock as I used to do the same job at the work, but I was doing it work, piece work, for baby's,

04:02:29.412 --> 04:02:38.025
baby's clothing, used to do, I'll show you when we finish I showed you what I was doing. And eh

04:02:38.025 --> 04:02:46.724
it was really, really good, till Marie got bigger. She went to school and that place closed down and

04:02:46.724 --> 04:02:56.120
I found myself another place where to work. And that was Rolston Dressing Gowns.  Beautiful place, beautiful

04:02:56.120 --> 04:03:04.906
place. And they gave me school hour work.  So when school holidays were on, I used to take work home,

04:03:04.906 --> 04:03:13.693
because I had a, a sowing machine who could do appliquÃ©, so I used to do for, for the work I used to

04:03:13.693 --> 04:03:18.999
do, there I used to do the applicate work on school holidays.

04:03:19.000 --> 04:03:27.949
And sometime we used to have a strike at the warff and they couldn't deliver the material, then

04:03:27.949 --> 04:03:36.806
I used to help them out at home, because we were not allowed to work when the strike was on. But

04:03:36.806 --> 04:03:45.755
I used to help out at work and  somehow, you know, we, we got it and it was an, a year before the

04:03:45.755 --> 04:03:54.889
money was changed, we managed to have a little bit of money and we bought ourselves a car! And that

04:03:54.889 --> 04:04:02.270
was, the money was changed here in eighty  six  or '84 from pounds to dollars.

04:04:02.270 --> 04:04:02.660
Yes.

04:04:02.660 --> 04:04:10.647
So we bought that  an English automatic car. And that was still for the pounds. And it was lovely.

04:04:10.647 --> 04:04:18.635
First my husband got his drivers license, then Andrew got his drivers license and I got my drivers

04:04:18.635 --> 04:04:26.459
license. And we were all th, three of us driving the same car. And then, when my husband retired

04:04:26.459 --> 04:04:34.202
he couldn't drive anymore, he couldn't work because he had cataracts, he had to leave work,

04:04:34.202 --> 04:04:42.434
but I was still working and Marie got herself a job. And, by the way, Andrew got a very good scholar,

04:04:42.434 --> 04:04:50.585
he got a scholarship to the university. Eh, but he wasn't so good the first , second year I think,

04:04:50.585 --> 04:04:58.409
he flunked at something, he had to repeat it and he, anyhow, there was a lot, a lot of things in

04:04:58.409 --> 04:05:06.234
between where he was working eh, eh at school, school holidays he used to try to work. And Marie

04:05:06.234 --> 04:05:14.058
wanted to be very, very much a pathologist.  I think it's called a pathologist, you test blood

04:05:14.058 --> 04:05:21.883
in a hospital. But she couldn't get in, so she went back to the eh college and she got herself

04:05:21.883 --> 04:05:26.039
a diploma for pharmaceutical eh, what is it called?

04:05:26.960 --> 04:05:27.580
Assistant?

04:05:27.580 --> 04:05:29.220
Pharma, eh, but she could have

04:05:30.340 --> 04:05:30.430
Pharmacist?

04:05:30.430 --> 04:05:38.727
Pharmacist yes, but not only for eh, even for, for  eh  farmers, to test things for the, the farmers

04:05:38.727 --> 04:05:46.776
and all that. It wasn't just eh, eh for the pharmacy in the city, she had double, double things

04:05:46.776 --> 04:05:54.742
and, if me move somewhere, like when she moved to Tasmania, she could work there for the farmers

04:05:54.742 --> 04:06:03.040
and she could work in any pharmacy shop. And she still s, now she gave up the pharmaceutical because

04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:11.587
she couldn't and then  twelve years ago [laughs], I thought I will never, never get, be a grandmother

04:06:11.587 --> 04:06:19.553
and one day Marie came over on Mother's day, they were living in Tasmania then, she came over

04:06:19.553 --> 04:06:27.768
for Mother's day and Andrew was living with his partner and she put on her plate a little present

04:06:27.768 --> 04:06:35.899
for Mother's day and she said, mum aren't you go to unwrap it? I said oh you have got a little

04:06:35.899 --> 04:06:44.363
bit of time, but I didn't noticed that she looked any different and when the presents for Mother's

04:06:44.363 --> 04:06:52.412
day was unwrapped and she had beautiful cotton blue and white cotton booties, the, baby's first

04:06:52.412 --> 04:07:00.544
booties. And it didn't register straight away, but Robin, Andrew's partner, screamed. And then

04:07:00.544 --> 04:07:08.925
I knew what was happening. My daughter was pregnant. I couldn't believe that that will ever happen!

04:07:08.925 --> 04:07:17.223
Because she was already married for quite a while and she was , I figure almost fourty when Nicholas

04:07:17.223 --> 04:07:17.970
was born.

04:07:18.560 --> 04:07:26.430
So when were you in touch again with Germany and Sobibor? How did that happen?

04:07:26.430 --> 04:07:34.201
Oh that happened, oh in nine  eighty three, 1983, but before that they called me to the German

04:07:34.201 --> 04:07:41.973
consulate in, in Sydney. And they had a b, some lawyers and some, I don't know, but five men

04:07:41.973 --> 04:07:49.662
came over from Germany and one defendant, that was for me, he was defendant me, and they were

04:07:49.662 --> 04:07:57.681
asking questions. And they had a very, because I was telling them what I remembered and all that,

04:07:57.681 --> 04:08:05.370
but that was not in '83, that could have been '82 or 1980, in Sydney. And my daughter was

04:08:05.370 --> 04:08:12.150
with me. Because Andrew was already eh somewhere else, he couldn't come with me.

04:08:12.150 --> 04:08:20.787
And they wouldn't, he would not have helped anyhow and eh then they was asking a lot about Sobibor.

04:08:20.787 --> 04:08:29.082
And then I was telling them what I could and about Gomersky about other ScharfÃ¼hrers, Wagner and

04:08:29.082 --> 04:08:37.804
what Wagner did to me and all that. Could I recognise, what Wagner, everybody know what, what happened

04:08:37.804 --> 04:08:46.099
to Wagner, but Gomersky could I recognise him? I said if I saw maybe I could, but I wasn't sure

04:08:46.099 --> 04:08:54.565
what they were planning to do. They brought over a very big album. With SS-men. And normal soldiers

04:08:54.565 --> 04:09:03.544
and private eh Nazi people. Not in the uniforms anymore, but in, in civil clothing and I should recognise

04:09:03.544 --> 04:09:09.360
Gomersky. If I would recognise him, then they knew that I was in, in

04:09:09.360 --> 04:09:09.360
Sobibor.

04:09:09.360 --> 04:09:09.800
Sobibor. And I looked

04:09:09.800 --> 04:09:12.900
Had they found you or, or ?

04:09:13.430 --> 04:09:20.481
eh, I don't know how they found me, that I live in, maybe through the United States,

04:09:20.481 --> 04:09:27.532
because I've put in a claim for restitution. And that's how they found me. I still

04:09:27.532 --> 04:09:35.076
had that German Arbeitsbuch where I was and I had witnesses, Zelda, was in the United States

04:09:35.076 --> 04:09:41.390
a witness I was in Sobibor, Esther Raab was there and there was  Samuel Lerer

04:09:41.390 --> 04:09:41.880
Hmhm.

04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:44.300
I knew he lives in the United States.

04:09:44.300 --> 04:09:44.460
You had contact with them?

04:09:44.460 --> 04:09:53.115
I had contact with them. Someday needed me as a witness and I needed them for witness and I was called

04:09:53.115 --> 04:10:01.517
to Sydney. And then not straight away to Germany, and then they wanted me to recognise Gomersky and

04:10:01.517 --> 04:10:10.173
eh I looked over that album, I looked as much as I could and I couldn't see them and they, you know,

04:10:10.173 --> 04:10:18.744
gave up at me. But they had a break for lunch, but I didn't go with them for lunch, I stayed at the

04:10:18.744 --> 04:10:27.400
at, at, the, the room there, the, the German consulate and I asked the lady who was eh  a little help

04:10:27.400 --> 04:10:36.140
me out with, I knew very perfect in German, help me out with everything, and English, and to leave that

04:10:36.140 --> 04:10:44.711
album with me. I want slowly to go over. And I must find, because I still remember Gomersky's face.

04:10:44.711 --> 04:10:53.282
And you wouldn't believe it that I found him. You know they had every photograph, just numbers, but

04:10:53.282 --> 04:11:01.769
they had another catalogue, the number points to Gomersky was number twelve, and later on in the sa,

04:11:01.769 --> 04:11:10.340
I said that is Gomersky and that lady, that, that secretary went to that other book and she looked up

04:11:10.340 --> 04:11:18.996
number twelve and that was Gomersky. So she even clapped that I found him.  And, anyhow, they accepted

04:11:18.996 --> 04:11:27.736
it and after that I was called to Germany in '83. As a witness for Frenzel. They told me when to come

04:11:27.736 --> 04:11:36.647
and doc, eh, eh, judge Kremer rang me up at Sydney, explained everything and would I need a, interpreter.

04:11:36.647 --> 04:11:45.472
I said eh an English interpreter, but you know what they did? They gave me a Polish interpreter, because

04:11:45.472 --> 04:11:54.638
I come from Poland. It didn't matter, you know? And I could still speak to them in German, if I couldn't

04:11:54.638 --> 04:12:03.124
get it, if I, I know that the eh interpreter didn't said it right, I could correct it in German to

04:12:03.124 --> 04:12:11.949
them.  And [swallows] Andrew came with me. I said I'm not coming alone to Germany and when my daughter

04:12:11.949 --> 04:12:20.775
was still living, I think she was already in Tasmania living, in '83  or maybe she was still studying,

04:12:20.775 --> 04:12:29.431
my dear , the, the, dates, the, the, the year and the dates aren't sometimes, not hazy but I can't

04:12:29.431 --> 04:12:30.280
place that

04:12:30.280 --> 04:12:30.630
It doesn't matter.

04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:39.762
that doesn't matter, and then, when I got to Germany with Andrew, we got to Frankfurt  and eh

04:12:39.762 --> 04:12:48.895
when we were, from Frankfurt we board eh a train to Hagen and when we arrived at Hagen we were

04:12:48.895 --> 04:12:58.027
taken to the hotel, to, everything was so beautifully arranged, everything! And first of all it

04:12:58.027 --> 04:13:06.679
was from Sydney eh, eh, is not eh, not first class but eh, what is the other class called?

04:13:07.470 --> 04:13:07.900
Business class.

04:13:07.900 --> 04:13:12.738
Business class, that was very nice, Lufthansa, , you know,

04:13:12.738 --> 04:13:16.910
flight and that was straight to, to, to Frankfurt.

04:13:17.250 --> 04:13:17.970
And, and

04:13:17.970 --> 04:13:17.970
Just go on.

04:13:17.970 --> 04:13:20.170
yes, I can go on

04:13:20.170 --> 04:13:20.680
Yes, sure.

04:13:20.680 --> 04:13:31.696
and that, when we arrived in Hagen every, everything was  really, really  good. When

04:13:31.696 --> 04:13:42.581
we were in the hotel, we had two visitors.  A gentleman and a lady came to visit is

04:13:42.581 --> 04:13:52.680
with flowers.  That was  Jules Schelvis, two Dutch people  and Dunya Brouwer?

04:13:52.680 --> 04:13:53.750
Breur, yes.

04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:56.370
Yes, how they pronouce it?

04:13:56.370 --> 04:13:56.960
Breur.

04:13:56.960 --> 04:14:05.643
Breur, Breur. And eh they were all time there, when everything was going on. It was about five days.

04:14:05.643 --> 04:14:13.893
But then we had an interruption  for Easter I think. And we had to come back, we had a few days

04:14:13.893 --> 04:14:22.577
off and while I was off, I went with Dunya and with Schelvis to Holland, because it was Easter time,

04:14:22.577 --> 04:14:31.174
Pesach. And Andrew went with his partner to  eh, England, something  not actually London, but other

04:14:31.174 --> 04:14:39.684
places. My tinnitis just came on so loud! Eh, come on.  And  we got allright, then we got back and

04:14:39.684 --> 04:14:48.281
everything was allright and whatever happened in Hagen I don't have to tell you, I think you know

04:14:48.281 --> 04:14:54.100
all about it. While I was asked what to do and what to say and what

04:14:54.100 --> 04:14:59.730
I want you to, for the, for the video to tell the story of the map.

04:14:59.940 --> 04:15:08.472
Of the map, yes I will tell you. Before the map I will tell something else. You know, they were talking

04:15:08.472 --> 04:15:16.839
and, you know, I was sitting there. Mein eh translator was sitting there. And where you were sitting,

04:15:16.839 --> 04:15:25.289
there was Frenzel and he, and his lawyer. But I had to turn my back a little bit, so I wouldn't look

04:15:25.289 --> 04:15:33.821
at Frenzel. Only I was looking straight where the judges were. There were about two or three judges and

04:15:33.821 --> 04:15:42.271
some prosecutors and they had everything on the tapes what I said in Sydney. And what I said somewhere

04:15:42.271 --> 04:15:50.886
else, you know, when I was interviewed and they had it, and then it was quite a few years after and that

04:15:50.886 --> 04:15:59.170
was in '83, 1983 in Hagen and they were asking question and I was telling them and all that and of

04:15:59.170 --> 04:16:07.620
a sudden somebody, I don't know, it wasn't judge Kremer, somebody else, did I see who was shooting

04:16:07.620 --> 04:16:15.987
when I was escaping? Did I see who was shooting?  Then I couldn't keep quiet any longer, I stood up

04:16:15.987 --> 04:16:24.685
and told them straight in their eyes would you look back if somebody was shooting at you?  Wir verzeihen,

04:16:24.685 --> 04:16:29.489
eh verzeihen Sie mir bitte. . Entschuldigen Sie mir bitte.

04:16:29.490 --> 04:16:39.805
Yes. And the same thing was with, with judge Kremer, but he was a civilized person, not like the others.

04:16:39.805 --> 04:16:49.724
And then la, Frenzel's lawyer tried so very hard to discredit me. He tried very hard and I said to

04:16:49.724 --> 04:16:59.941
them you have everything black on white, or you have everything on tapes and I'm getting older, I'm

04:16:59.941 --> 04:17:10.356
not old yet, but I have to have everything in my head. And if sometimes a sentence is said back to front,

04:17:10.356 --> 04:17:20.572
you must understand that.  And then when it came to that, to that time when I saw, I went to the toilet

04:17:20.572 --> 04:17:30.690
and I saw to that bush, it was a fence, it was a gate, but we called it fence, bush fence, naked women

04:17:30.690 --> 04:17:40.510
were walking in that particular road from one camp to the third camp, was called the Himmelstrasse

04:17:40.510 --> 04:17:46.660
and they were walking to the gas chambers, they were all naked

04:17:46.660 --> 04:17:47.320
Naked, yes.

04:17:47.320 --> 04:17:54.241
and I had to show on the map where that was. Everybody was, knew where our toilets were,

04:17:54.241 --> 04:18:01.319
because we were that many in the camp, you know, because the, the girls, the women and the

04:18:01.319 --> 04:18:07.690
girls had only a different barrack from the men, but it was in the same compound.

04:18:07.690 --> 04:18:08.100
Sure.

04:18:08.100 --> 04:18:10.430
Yes, anyhow.

04:18:10.620 --> 04:18:17.503
And, anyhow, and when he told me, judge Kremer told me, he even gave me, not a pencil but

04:18:17.503 --> 04:18:24.310
a little stick to show where that bush fence was, where the toilets were and I went down

04:18:24.310 --> 04:18:27.250
And where you could look outside to see

04:18:27.250 --> 04:18:28.420
that where I could

04:18:28.420 --> 04:18:28.830
Himmelstrasse

04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:37.095
yes, from when I was going to the toilet I could see it, and then I was, had to show it to them.

04:18:37.095 --> 04:18:46.050
And when I got down, because that was like a big blackboard, and that map was hanging on that blackboard

04:18:46.050 --> 04:18:54.402
[swallows] and I went down to it and I looked at it and I looked at it, and I couldn't find it.

04:18:54.402 --> 04:19:02.926
And I said to judge Kremer, he came down, after I said eh that is not the map of Sobibor. And that,

04:19:02.926 --> 04:19:11.364
that lawyer was so, sitting there and smiling, he was so happy about it. So judge Kramer came down

04:19:11.364 --> 04:19:19.802
from the podium and he came over to the map and he had a look at it and he said can I excu, excuse

04:19:19.802 --> 04:19:28.240
me please, somebody turned it around, it's upside down.  And he put it right on that stand where

04:19:28.240 --> 04:19:36.851
the map was, like a blackboard and I showed him there were the toilets and there's the bush fence.

04:19:36.851 --> 04:19:45.633
And you should have heard in that court the clapping. Because there were a lot of students, university

04:19:45.633 --> 04:19:53.813
students and other school people and ordinary people, I don't know, and then that was  thing,

04:19:53.813 --> 04:20:02.079
that, that, that lawyer, Frenzel's lawyer couldn't cross me off that I'm not pretending to

04:20:02.079 --> 04:20:04.490
be at, at Sobibor, you know.

04:20:04.490 --> 04:20:10.220
Was it a trap they had put out for you, or was it an accident?

04:20:10.220 --> 04:20:18.193
I don't know who did, they don't know who did it.  You know. I don't know. Till today I

04:20:18.193 --> 04:20:26.253
tried to find out who was there, was it the cleaner, was it somebody who could have put upside

04:20:26.253 --> 04:20:34.313
down and you never checked it before you called me over to it?  I wish I could speak very well

04:20:34.313 --> 04:20:41.429
German, I could speak to you. How is it in German to check, warum haben Sie nich eh

04:20:41.610 --> 04:20:42.520
Kontroliert?

04:20:43.840 --> 04:20:44.090
spI

04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:45.050
? Verifiert?

04:20:45.960 --> 04:20:53.160
No, there's another word for it, we, fe, why didn't you check it before, warom haben

04:20:53.160 --> 04:21:00.524
Sie nicht eh das, das gesehen? Dat, das, das, that, that isn't, nicht eh, forgive me, I,

04:21:00.524 --> 04:21:07.724
I can speak German, but not when I have to speak to somebody. It comes out with a lot of

04:21:07.724 --> 04:21:14.270
English. You know how it is with a language, if you don't use it, you lose it.

04:21:14.270 --> 04:21:14.420
Yes.

04:21:14.420 --> 04:21:19.564
Yes. But when I read, I can understand every word from a German

04:21:19.564 --> 04:21:23.810
magazine, a book. And I still have got German stuff.

04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:30.990
So from Hagen you made contact with Jules and Dunya

04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.470
Yes, yes.

04:21:31.470 --> 04:21:34.240
you already had contact with the other survivors?

04:21:34.740 --> 04:21:40.278
I think they have, they have been there, because there were never two survivors called over

04:21:40.278 --> 04:21:45.270
to Hagen together. They, everybody, when they want to come as a witness, they were

04:21:45.270 --> 04:21:47.550
They had to come alone.

04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:54.996
they were marked, marked out different times. So I don't know who came after me. It could

04:21:54.996 --> 04:22:02.197
have been, but I still, later on I couldn't find out what they did to Frenzel, because

04:22:02.197 --> 04:22:09.888
they said he's not a well man, he was already in, in eh  in jail and he was released because

04:22:09.888 --> 04:22:17.580
of health problems and all. He himself had five children at home, he was only a cabinet maker,

04:22:17.580 --> 04:22:25.026
Frenzel, before he, he became a SS-man and all that. But I didn't know all that. And then

04:22:25.026 --> 04:22:30.100
people were asking me, wou, did he got sentenced again. I said

04:22:30.100 --> 04:22:38.633
I said don't ask me, because I couldn't care less what happened to him. But when I came back

04:22:38.633 --> 04:22:47.167
to Sydney, you should have seen, the Sydney Jewish Museum, there wasn't a Jewish lawyer, there

04:22:47.167 --> 04:22:56.056
wasn't even another lawyer, they wanted to know how it, a  came along like that in a German court,

04:22:56.056 --> 04:23:04.856
how many were there, ex, expect me, you know, alone to be alone without anybody who could be beside

04:23:04.856 --> 04:23:13.479
me, only my son was with me.  You know? Who, who could, he couldn't even protect me because he,

04:23:13.479 --> 04:23:22.279
he was only, he knew what I was telling. He  I was alone there and I had to protect myself. If they

04:23:22.279 --> 04:23:31.346
would have had, like Frenzel had a lawyer, I should have had a lawyer too.  But I didn't, I didn't

04:23:31.346 --> 04:23:40.679
know I could have asked for one.  But one thing it was very, very good, that judge Kremer was a beautiful

04:23:40.679 --> 04:23:49.391
human being. I kept forgetting that he is a German judge, because he was so humane. And the others

04:23:49.391 --> 04:23:58.280
were not like that, they kept on asking questions, like asking me did I see who was shooting. Kremer

04:23:58.280 --> 04:24:06.902
didn't ask that. Or there was another question: how did I know that the, in the th, third camp,

04:24:06.902 --> 04:24:15.703
because mein brother was in the third camp and found out, but that's a little too much to stretch

04:24:15.703 --> 04:24:24.503
it out, how I found out that the younger brother was in the third camp and then they were executed,

04:24:24.503 --> 04:24:33.036
the 27th of June, how did I know there were 27 eh inmates  in third camp?  And I said, I don't

04:24:33.036 --> 04:24:41.570
know who asked me that question, another judge or was it Kremer, I said I didn't know how many

04:24:41.570 --> 04:24:50.104
was there, but then I stood up and I asked judge Kramer would you have forgotten your mother's

04:24:50.104 --> 04:24:59.259
birthday? He said no. I said the 27th of June was my mother's birthday, I never said how many inmates

04:24:59.259 --> 04:25:00.859
was in camp three.

04:25:02.250 --> 04:25:02.690
But you knew the day.

04:25:02.690 --> 04:25:10.329
I knew the date because that when my brother was hot, the whole lot, something happened there

04:25:10.329 --> 04:25:17.968
where they were working to the mines, one night they exploded and they, it was said that they

04:25:17.968 --> 04:25:25.607
wanted to escape and somebody said a, a dog went over and then the mine exploded and that was

04:25:25.607 --> 04:25:33.246
the 27th of June.  You know. Everybody in the camp, the girls knew. Why did it have to happen

04:25:33.246 --> 04:25:40.803
to him, and that's my mother's birthday today.  And that's what I told, told the, the,

04:25:40.803 --> 04:25:46.799
in, in the court. But I stood up and I said it in German to judge Kremer.

04:25:46.800 --> 04:25:52.340
It was also the beginning of our friendship with Dunya, isn't it?

04:25:52.340 --> 04:25:52.700
Pardon?

04:25:52.700 --> 04:25:55.590
It is also the beginning of our friendship with

04:25:55.590 --> 04:26:05.528
That friendship with Dunya is hard to describe. She was a friend, she was a sister, she was a brother

04:26:05.528 --> 04:26:15.072
and a mother, was the most precious person for me.  Because I got to know her.  And when I was in

04:26:15.072 --> 04:26:24.715
Amsterdam, in the Rijksmuseum, Dunya took me to that room where her mother had a room of the, the,

04:26:24.715 --> 04:26:34.555
the, the things from her book. She had a room and on the door was that big boot [or booth?] hanging,

04:26:34.555 --> 04:26:41.640
I've got a small boot [or booth?] hanging from that RavensbrÃ¼ck camp.

04:26:41.640 --> 04:26:43.350
Because Dunya's mother was in RavensbrÃ¼ck?

04:26:43.350 --> 04:26:52.183
Yes. And I want to show you, I've got something hanging in the laundry what Dunya send me over from

04:26:52.183 --> 04:27:00.928
RavensbrÃ¼ck.  Oh gosh, Dunya was something that nobody can replace her for me and for Andrew It was

04:27:00.928 --> 04:27:09.674
something that we have a bond.  You should have seen the photograph, the children when I stayed with

04:27:09.674 --> 04:27:18.245
her, I send this photograph back and, and Jetje gave it to the sons, because when they were little

04:27:18.245 --> 04:27:27.427
children, I stayed there with Dunya. You know both children were with me, we used to speak a lot. Anyhow,

04:27:27.427 --> 04:27:36.260
and I couldn't maybe understand that, but Dunya, Dunya was speaking Germany and I speak German, she

04:27:36.260 --> 04:27:44.919
could speak English just as good as German, but better German than, than English and I was a lot, I

04:27:44.919 --> 04:27:53.752
was really good with German then [laughs]. And then  there are certain things I have forgiven people,

04:27:53.752 --> 04:28:02.497
but one thing I will never forgive, Jules not to let me know when she passed away. Through a student

04:28:02.497 --> 04:28:11.418
in Melbourne, who was interesting, he just came back from Amsterdam  and he was interesting about that

04:28:11.418 --> 04:28:19.989
I, how he found out about Dunya and he told me that Dunya is not there. And that was, her birthday

04:28:19.989 --> 04:28:28.734
was the 30th of June and I send a birthday card and always little presents, not eleborate things but

04:28:28.734 --> 04:28:37.392
so she will remember me, you know, and  she died. I don't know a day for her, before her birthday

04:28:37.392 --> 04:28:46.838
or a day after her birthday and Jules never let me know. And I, and I told him  I can forgive you everything

04:28:46.838 --> 04:28:55.671
wrong  but I'll never forgive you for that. You know what Dunya was for us both, for Andrew and for

04:28:55.671 --> 04:28:58.119
myself.  And even for Marie.

04:29:00.650 --> 04:29:07.510
Now  I think we have most  the subjects we could do.

04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.890
Yes.

04:29:07.890 --> 04:29:12.720
But is there something we have forgotten or is there a message you have at the end of the interview?

04:29:14.280 --> 04:29:15.490
A message to who?

04:29:15.490 --> 04:29:15.490
The world.

04:29:15.490 --> 04:29:17.660
To the world?

04:29:18.650 --> 04:29:19.380
To yourself?

04:29:19.380 --> 04:29:28.946
Yes. I'll tell you something. Never  eh I don't want, how shall I say, eh, vengeance. Because I'm

04:29:28.946 --> 04:29:38.698
not build for, I'm not born for vengeance. I only would like that it would be done  right, I'll never

04:29:38.698 --> 04:29:48.078
forget, get and I will never forgive them. But whatever I do, it's not because I hate them, because

04:29:48.078 --> 04:29:57.366
hate is disease, it will eat me up. But I'll never forgive them what they did.  I know there's a

04:29:57.366 --> 04:30:07.118
new generation, I don't hate the new generation, I don't, don't eh  how shall I say, the  they've

04:30:07.118 --> 04:30:16.499
got new live now, they can't look back. And I maybe should not look back, but it's so hard. And I

04:30:16.499 --> 04:30:25.972
couldn't burry the things what happened to me when I was younger, but when I'm, one gets older you

04:30:25.972 --> 04:30:35.631
can't shake it.  When I was younger I should, could shake it off like a duck shakes off the water from

04:30:35.631 --> 04:30:44.919
the, from the feathers. But I can't do it now. It stays with me. All the time.  And what I can say

04:30:44.919 --> 04:30:54.300
to the world, be good, be a good man, don't harm anybody, think twice when you  eh, don't forgive

04:30:54.300 --> 04:30:59.780
somebody, there's always forgiveness for a lot of things.

04:30:59.780 --> 04:31:06.596
Now there's a poem you just cited to me by which you want to show your generousity

04:31:06.596 --> 04:31:11.790
to all others who have suffered. Do you re, mind to repeat that?

04:31:12.130 --> 04:31:13.160
What is it, for that, that's

04:31:13.160 --> 04:31:13.160
Yes.

04:31:13.160 --> 04:31:13.440
that is a song.

04:31:13.440 --> 04:31:13.440
Yes.

04:31:13.440 --> 04:31:13.440
Yes.

04:31:13.440 --> 04:31:16.390
Do you want to sing it, or you want to

04:31:16.390 --> 04:31:46.196
I maybe a tiny  it, because I haven't got, because of mein nose and throat, mein eh voice

04:31:46.196 --> 04:32:12.400
is not good to sing it, but I will remind a little bit the melody maybe. [sings]

04:32:12.400 --> 04:32:16.151
Ich will mich vergessen, singen sehr viel, alles wie ein Traum, wie in Kinderspiel ,  wo ist mein Welt,

04:32:16.151 --> 04:32:19.830
auf der grosse Welt, wo ist mein Heim, wo ist mein Zelt, freulich spielt Zigeuner Lieder, Ich mÃ¶chte

04:32:19.830 --> 04:32:23.509
vergessen von All, klingeln  von den Zigeuner Walz,  schon Alles in Leben verloren, kein mother, kein

04:32:23.509 --> 04:32:27.152
father, kein Heim, bin Ich den von ein Stein geboren, warum ist die Welt von mir weit. Die Sonne hat

04:32:27.152 --> 04:32:30.758
niemals fÃ¼r mich nicht gescheint, der Regen hat immer with mir mit geweint, kein father or mother,

04:32:30.758 --> 04:32:34.401
mother hat mich nicht erzogen, och nein, gepflecht hat mich der Wind und der Schnee, freulich spielt

04:32:34.401 --> 04:32:38.043
Zigeuner Lieder, Ich mÃ¶chte vergessen von All. That's the refrain.  I guess and from now klingeln

04:32:38.043 --> 04:32:41.759
soll jeden  von den Zigeuner Walz,  schon Alles in Leben verloren, kein Vater, kein Mutter, kein Heim,

04:32:41.759 --> 04:32:44.200
bin Ich den von ein Stein geboren, warom ist die Welt von mir weit.

04:32:44.200 --> 04:33:13.100
Can I ask you something, where you

04:33:13.100 --> 04:33:13.310
Yes.

04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:16.660
this, this poem, this song is very important to you.

04:33:16.660 --> 04:33:17.990
Yes.

04:33:18.610 --> 04:33:22.960
Do you feel yourself a Zigeuner or, or

04:33:22.960 --> 04:33:29.866
I fee, I, I felt myself when it happened, because he hasn't got anything in the world,

04:33:29.866 --> 04:33:36.459
he hasn't got a home, he hasn't got a  you know, hasn't got the, the, the , he

04:33:36.459 --> 04:33:43.051
hasn't got a mother or a father, didn't, didn't bring him up  it looks like he

04:33:43.051 --> 04:33:49.566
never had anything, he, and he was asking bin Ich denn von ein Stein geboren? Warum

04:33:49.566 --> 04:33:55.059
ist die Welt von mir so weit?  And that Zigeuner used to be like that.

04:33:55.180 --> 04:33:56.660
Now you became a

04:33:56.660 --> 04:33:58.900
And I became a Zigeuner.

04:34:00.010 --> 04:34:00.500
Thank you Regina.

04:34:00.500 --> 04:34:11.403
Not that I became a Zigeuner, but I felt like that Zigeuner. And there's another little

04:34:11.403 --> 04:34:23.287
song in Polish, that somebody came and recorded, from Sydney, he's a professor of international

04:34:23.287 --> 04:34:34.191
song writing and I, I didn't know that he will record it and he got it even translated!

04:34:34.191 --> 04:34:41.419
But that is in Polish, I never translated that in any other

04:34:41.420 --> 04:34:46.230
Can you tell in Polish? We'll translate it.

04:34:51.290 --> 04:35:01.216
I can tell in Polish of course. A mother, a woman was asking a, eh little boy,  [says something

04:35:01.216 --> 04:35:11.351
in Polish], that was a recorder, he was playing, a little boy [says something in Polish] and that

04:35:11.351 --> 04:35:21.382
boy answered [says something in Polish] mama will translate it later. [says something in Polish]

04:35:21.382 --> 04:35:31.726
And then he came on s, not singing, but the music [says something in Polish], you now that recorder

04:35:31.726 --> 04:35:42.280
[says something in Polish]. Now I'll translate it for you. A woman was asking a boy who was playing

04:35:42.280 --> 04:35:52.519
with a melody, and that melody had words and she ask him: why Johnny do you, is your music so sad?

04:35:52.519 --> 04:36:02.550
And he said because I'm sad, because I haven't got, I've, my father and my mother died af,

04:36:02.550 --> 04:36:12.790
straight after him and their graves are just there behind the hill. And then he started on playing

04:36:12.790 --> 04:36:22.821
and he said to his recorder [says something in Polish] please eh, eh make the music, let's all

04:36:22.821 --> 04:36:32.852
the hills and the fields and the meadows hear you, the music and let them know how hard it is to

04:36:32.852 --> 04:36:38.390
be a, eh  [says something in Polish] that is, what is

04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:39.530
Say it in German.

04:36:39.530 --> 04:36:42.870
eh, it hasn't got any, parents, what is the child called? Eh, orphan

04:36:42.870 --> 04:36:43.150
Orphan.

04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:50.660
but the hardest pain in life is to be an orphan. And that is

04:36:50.660 --> 04:36:57.920
from the primary school, that song. I know dozens of them.

04:36:57.920 --> 04:36:59.200
Regina, thank you very much.

04:36:59.200 --> 04:36:59.200
Thank
