WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.140
Off we go.

00:10.410 --> 00:19.483
My name is Martin Haas and eh I was born Martijn Haas in the end of 1936, eh, in Breda, a small

00:19.483 --> 00:28.461
city in the southern Netherlands, eh, eh, wholly, just about wholly eh, eh, ca, very Catholic

00:28.461 --> 00:37.630
city. There used to be, I think when, the time I was born, less than 200 Jews in the whole city.

00:37.630 --> 00:46.799
There was one small synagogue that, times has been another one. Anyway, I was the fourth of four

00:46.799 --> 00:55.777
children, to a eh, middle class middle class family. And it's a middle class because eh, eh,

00:55.777 --> 01:04.660
my family, my father Haas, had two sisters, so I had two aunts and eh  a  my grandfather, who

01:04.660 --> 01:13.638
died in 1933, I never knew him, my Haas grandfather, eh, died in 1933, is buried in the Jewish

01:13.638 --> 01:22.711
cemetery in Breda. And eh  he had a, I think saved every penny he could save while working hard

01:22.711 --> 01:31.689
and established a very credible business eh, that was on the Terheijdenstraat, which doesn't

01:31.689 --> 01:41.145
exist anymore, eh, double herenhuis, a double house, one half was his, my grandfather's business,

01:41.145 --> 01:45.730
it said manufacturen, eh, eh, f, firma I.E. Haas

01:45.730 --> 01:46.160
Hmhm

01:46.160 --> 01:54.127
Isaac Haas, manufacturen en gros. and I have pictures of that and he eh  eh, the other side was the,

01:54.127 --> 02:02.334
was the house for eh my father and his family lived; later when my grandfather died eh it was basically

02:02.334 --> 02:11.258
taken over by my family, by my father and family. It was, it was absolutely a, I would call it upper-middleclass

02:11.258 --> 02:19.625
family because they owned houses all over Breda. I mean not one or two, but probably close to a, a dozen.

02:19.625 --> 02:27.593
Eh, my father had a car, which was quite unusual in the thirties. Eh and, anyway, eh, eh, a, a very,

02:27.593 --> 02:35.720
very established eh, eh, eh, eh family. Not rich but eh I think the family could do what it wanted and

02:35.720 --> 02:43.688
was very careful with money. Jewish family, I know obviously, because I remember, have some memories

02:43.688 --> 02:51.735
there, which I will, will tell about. Eh and eh, eh, I, in recent years, visited eh, eh  a year and a

02:51.735 --> 02:59.863
half ago and six, seven years ago, I visited Breda and went to s, to, to the synagogue, which has been

02:59.863 --> 03:07.990
rebuilt. And there eh, eh, people who are the Jewish community there showed us eh, eh, a book in which

03:07.990 --> 03:15.958
my father with his eh, eh, eh, donated money to the congregation. And you know, on, on the holy day,

03:15.958 --> 03:24.005
on Shabbat, that's done by folding a piece of paper and there was, was, so it was clear that he was

03:24.005 --> 03:27.910
a supporting member of the community etcetera. Eh

03:27.910 --> 03:29.260
Which year were you born?

03:29.260 --> 03:33.526
I was born in October nine, October, 20th of October 1936.

03:33.526 --> 03:37.720
And so when the war broke out I was not yet, not yet four.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.500
Hmhm.

03:39.100 --> 03:47.581
Eh, in fact, when my father was  eh, eh, oh, I have to, what else I have to, have to say, about this

03:47.581 --> 03:55.978
background eh  ja, maybe, maybe you start here. Eh, in the beginning of the war, I don't know all

03:55.978 --> 04:04.121
the details because I was small and of, having actually have not read up properly, eh, Breda was

04:04.121 --> 04:12.857
a garrison town  of the Dutch army and navy I believe, eh, and eh, eh, so the German, the, the invading

04:12.857 --> 04:21.678
Nazi's eh, the Germans on the fifth of May 1940, eh, targeted it eh and particularly its real reliance

04:21.678 --> 04:29.821
it was an important eh, a connecting eh place, eh, for railways and so they targeted eh  eh, the

04:29.821 --> 04:35.080
railway lines of Breda, the, actually the, the railway station

04:35.080 --> 04:35.080
Hmhm

04:35.080 --> 04:39.712
which was very close to our house and I think the bo, eh, eh the pilots

04:39.712 --> 04:44.214
must not be, have been very good because they hit our house. And some

04:44.214 --> 04:48.390
other houses around the Terheijdenstraat in Breda was destroyed.

04:48.390 --> 04:48.880
Hm

04:48.880 --> 04:54.847
And eh, nobody  of my family was hurt, I don't, do not know if others were hurt,

04:54.847 --> 05:01.252
do not know, eh, in the same street, but eh I think eh this was at a time, the beginning

05:01.252 --> 05:05.909
of the war, that all of Breda was emptied by the eh authorities.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.020
Hmhm

05:07.020 --> 05:10.640
in order to, their apparently knew there would be an, eh, an attack on the city.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.690
And everybody walked, and I must have been very small, everybody

05:14.690 --> 05:15.220
Four, yes

05:15.220 --> 05:21.636
Four, or, or, yes, four, eh, everybody walked, not yet four, 3Â½ actually,

05:21.636 --> 05:27.360
36, seven, eight, nine, in October '40, I was four. So I was 3Â½

05:27.360 --> 05:28.020
Yes

05:28.020 --> 05:34.920
So I remember nothing of this, eh, but everybody walked out in the di, eh, direction south to

05:34.920 --> 05:41.895
Antwerpen and eh, so they bombed the city when it was empty and nobody was killed or anything.

05:41.895 --> 05:48.869
So when we came back we moved in with a grand uncle, to another, another street, Speelhuislaan

05:48.869 --> 05:55.844
and eh, we stayed there and immediately, apparently, my father eh started moves to build a new

05:55.844 --> 06:02.967
house. And he started to move to build eh, he started building a new house for my, our immediate

06:02.967 --> 06:10.016
family, that is father, mother and four children and eh for my two aunts eh  Celine and  Adèle

06:10.016 --> 06:16.916
who where unmarried. They were probably unmarried because they were kind of intelligent, they

06:16.916 --> 06:23.742
were very good eh at everything, but in nineteen thir, in the thirties, or twenties for that

06:23.742 --> 06:28.640
matter, eh, eh, women in Holland didn't study, couldn't study.

06:28.640 --> 06:29.490
Some did

06:29.490 --> 06:29.490
S, very

06:29.490 --> 06:29.980
Very few

06:29.980 --> 06:31.550
very few, very few

06:31.550 --> 06:32.790
And not in that region

06:32.790 --> 06:39.559
And certainly not in that region, exactly. And so they did all kinds of things but they couldn't,

06:39.559 --> 06:46.808
eh they could have attained eh a doctor degree or anything in, eh, anything they wished, because they've

06:46.808 --> 06:53.646
certainly, were known to be very intelligent, but they didn't. Eh, and so he built a double house,

06:53.646 --> 07:00.348
he bought, eh, obviously right in the beginning of the, of the war, after the house was destroyed,

07:00.348 --> 07:06.981
bought a lot and started to build a house. And I don't know all the details about that, because

07:06.981 --> 07:13.751
I still have to inq, eh, to investigate that. But I heard from some others who have looked into it,

07:13.751 --> 07:20.453
from the archives in Breda, that eh, he had many, many difficulties getting building materials and

07:20.453 --> 07:27.496
building the house and, and eh, as a Jew being able to build the house, being allowed to build a house.

07:27.496 --> 07:34.676
And I actually remember, I must have then been, 4Â½, five, eh, prob, probably and possibly after visiting

07:34.676 --> 07:41.378
the synagogue. It may have been Shabbat, it may have been a holyday, that my whole family, father,

07:41.378 --> 07:48.079
mother, and four children, and I was the smallest, went to see progress of building the house. And

07:48.079 --> 07:54.849
I remember  quite well, eh, I tell you in a moment why, how come I remember that, that there was a,

07:54.849 --> 08:01.551
the basement was built and there were planks and what have you and we weren't allowed to walk on

08:01.551 --> 08:08.389
that of course, eh, we did, eh, and the beg, the house was actually getting, taking shape. They were

08:08.389 --> 08:15.296
building the in, the walls etcetera. And I remember that because we, children, I, but I'm sure also

08:15.296 --> 08:22.066
my siblings, were very happy because in the back of the house, towards the kitchen, there was a eh,

08:22.066 --> 08:28.904
circular stairs, staircase. Eh, eh, helical staircase going to the kitchen. So the baker and the eh,

08:28.904 --> 08:35.537
milkman and whoever, who came to deliver to the house, to the family didn't have to go in front

08:35.537 --> 08:42.444
where the business was going to be established. So it was very interesting. In fact, I have been back

08:42.444 --> 08:49.282
there for a couple of times, walked to the back of the house and saw that circular staircase. It's

08:49.282 --> 08:56.189
very interesting eh, to see that eh six, eh, 65 years after the events. That what I remember is still

08:56.189 --> 08:56.600
there.

08:56.600 --> 08:56.710
Wonderful.

08:56.710 --> 09:10.010
Anyway. Eh  in eh late, in October 1941 my father got eh, obviously, eh, directions eh, eh, eh,

09:10.010 --> 09:23.030
to be, eh, to, to show up for transport to Sobi, to eh, eh, in Friesland, what's called, eh

09:23.030 --> 09:23.500
Westerbork?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.350
Westerbork

09:24.770 --> 09:25.170
That's Drenthe

09:25.170 --> 09:32.304
Drenthe, okay, I've never been there and I don't think I will go. Eh, and from there he was eh

09:32.304 --> 09:39.365
transpo, eh, transported to Auschwitz and I have all, of course all the dates when, when and what

09:39.365 --> 09:46.718
and about half year later he died and I assume mo, most probably that in Auschwitz he was put to work

09:46.718 --> 09:53.997
and after all Arbeit macht frei and they made him very frei. Eh  he died in, in eh, eh, in Auschwitz

09:53.997 --> 10:00.040
in, I think early, oh, in sometime in '42. But I'm not really, I can look it up

10:00.040 --> 10:00.190
Early

10:00.190 --> 10:08.205
very early, very, quite early, quite early. Eh  we continued living one way and

10:08.205 --> 10:16.118
the other with my mother and there were all kinds of other family mem, family,

10:16.118 --> 10:24.133
family member and in October, forget the date, eh, 1942, eh we, the rest of the

10:24.133 --> 10:30.830
family, received orders to appear eh for transport to eh Wester eh

10:30.830 --> 10:31.070
Westerbork

10:31.070 --> 10:39.138
Westerbork again.  And eh, it was delayed, or our appearance, or our transport, whatever,

10:39.138 --> 10:47.026
was delayed because my sister had asthma. My little sister, the closest to me.  Roosje,

10:47.026 --> 10:54.551
Rosa had eh asthma and eh, they were so eh magnanimous that when a child had asthma

10:54.551 --> 10:59.810
they would postpone deportation to the death camps. Anyway

10:59.810 --> 11:01.800
The names of the other siblings were?

11:01.800 --> 11:13.514
The names were eh, the oldest was eh, eh Elisabeth, Liesje, eh, eh, the second was a boy, his name

11:13.514 --> 11:24.870
was Isaac, the third was eh, [grins] my sister Roosje and the fourth was eh me, myself, Martin.

11:24.870 --> 11:33.755
So the family got the orders to eh, to appear and it was a little, a little postponed, eh, then

11:33.755 --> 11:42.359
I, again, I don't remember, I can look it up but I don't remember all the dates, eh, eh,

11:42.359 --> 11:51.151
the evening before  eh the order to appear  eh  my mother had my, myself and my little sister,

11:51.151 --> 11:58.540
second sister, the two, the two youngest children, whisked of to Bergen op Zoom

11:58.540 --> 11:59.140
Hmhm.

11:59.140 --> 12:05.635
Eh, through an organization whose name I do not recall, I can look it up, but never

12:05.635 --> 12:12.444
mind, eh, of eh, eh lay Catholic eh, they weren't nuns, but they were social workers,

12:12.444 --> 12:19.097
who in the area of Breda helped women with their pregnancy and with birth and a time,

12:19.097 --> 12:25.671
some time after birth. And these women were, it, it was a Catholic organization, eh,

12:25.671 --> 12:31.150
apparently, it so appears, had helped other cathechisten. Cathechisten

12:31.150 --> 12:31.630
Ja.

12:31.630 --> 12:38.682
they were called. They helped eh my mother with some of the births, I'm not eh, so sure which, mine

12:38.682 --> 12:45.735
or my sisters or eh, other sister or brother, and they of course had helped many, many Christian, eh,

12:45.735 --> 12:52.718
Catholic families, all over, and through them, they worked for the Underground, and through them eh,

12:52.718 --> 12:59.840
eh, my mother found two addresses in Bergen op Zoom for the two children. The small children. The, and

12:59.840 --> 13:07.103
indeed, the evening before they were to appear, I, I did not know that, I did not, do not remember that,

13:07.103 --> 13:14.504
I was too eh, a little too small yet, eh, a lady came. I had never seen her and visited us in the evening,

13:14.504 --> 13:21.417
it was dark, it, we are talking about February, no it was October, I'm sorry, eh and she came, it

13:21.417 --> 13:28.400
was a rainy evening, and she came with a big cape, big black cape she had on, she wasn't very tall

13:28.400 --> 13:35.313
but a big black cape, and the two children, that, one of them myself and then my sister, went under

13:35.313 --> 13:42.506
that cape with her to the railway station, which was close,  we took the train to Bergen op Zoom. There

13:42.506 --> 13:49.489
my sister was taken by someone else who was waiting for her and that was an eh, I do not know who it

13:49.489 --> 13:53.189
was, of the, a man or wo, woman from the Baars family

13:53.190 --> 13:53.190
Hmhm

13:53.770 --> 14:00.763
and she was taken basically to them and I continued with Mrs., not Haas, but Hees, H, E, E,

14:00.763 --> 14:07.757
S. Interesting. Eh, I was Haas, he was Hees, and eh, was put to sleep, to bed and eh, until

14:07.757 --> 14:14.828
the next morning.  Eh, I stayed in Bergen op Zoom eh, actually very interesting stories, eh,

14:14.828 --> 14:21.821
until fffff, at least 1946, even though we were, the south was liberated on the 27th Bergen

14:21.821 --> 14:28.815
op Zoom, was liberated on 27th of October 1944, half a year before the rest of the country,

14:28.815 --> 14:36.040
eh because the, the eh Allies had to still cross the big rivers and it was a big job, was very

14:36.040 --> 14:43.187
difficult. And eh, so we had been free since '44, I stayed at least another year. I'm not

14:43.187 --> 14:50.411
eh quite sure exactly how long, eh, there, because, of course, first the war wasn't finished

14:50.411 --> 14:55.100
and when the war was finished nobody knew what to do with me.

14:55.100 --> 14:55.100
Sure

14:55.100 --> 15:01.902
They basically didn't know what to do with me.  Eh  in Bergen op Zoom it, of course is very

15:01.902 --> 15:08.705
important to remember, jawel eh first of all, I never saw my, my sister eh in Bergen op Zoom,

15:08.705 --> 15:15.361
though both of us were in the same town. I was sent a few months after I arrived, I stayed,

15:15.361 --> 15:22.090
I think indoors for a while, eh, like a couple of months, and then I was sent to school. And

15:22.090 --> 15:28.674
the school was right across the family, the Hees family home, and there was one person who

15:28.674 --> 15:35.403
was informed of who this sudden kid who showed up was and eh that was my teacher and she was

15:35.403 --> 15:42.279
in the secret, and I went to school and I started to learn. And I'm told now, recently, that

15:42.279 --> 15:47.180
I could learn very well. I didn't know [grins] I remember nothing

15:47.410 --> 15:47.730
[laughs]

15:47.730 --> 15:51.870
and that's what they say, I don't know [laughs]

15:51.870 --> 15:52.630
Yes professor Haas

15:52.630 --> 15:58.930
Ohoh, thank you very much. No, I actually didn't know. And eh, eh, and I did my schooling, I had

15:58.930 --> 16:05.681
a terrible handwriting, I remember that, eh, but anyway, I did learn. I did learn. And I grew up perfect,

16:05.681 --> 16:12.175
eh, eh, reasonably nor, reasonably normally, except that there were all kinds of arrangements. If the

16:12.175 --> 16:18.733
Gestapo were to come, what they would do with that, with me. And I don't remember this, these things

16:18.733 --> 16:23.620
have been told to me by some of the sisters and brothers from eh the family.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.830
Before you go on with

16:25.830 --> 16:25.830
Yes

16:25.830 --> 16:27.560
the life in eh

16:27.560 --> 16:27.560
Yes

16:27.560 --> 16:30.380
Bergen op Zoom, can we for a moment go back to

16:30.380 --> 16:30.850
Let's go back

16:30.850 --> 16:31.070
Breda?

16:31.070 --> 16:32.180
Sure!

16:32.240 --> 16:34.410
What are your earliest memories about Breda?

16:34.410 --> 16:34.410
Oh!

16:34.410 --> 16:38.550
Do you still, well, I don't know

16:38.550 --> 16:40.080
Good question.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.420
Because you skipped it.

16:41.420 --> 16:48.908
Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes, I can, I can't tell a bit, but quite a bit. Anyway, eh, I remember,

16:48.908 --> 16:56.236
very well, and I must have been four, going with my father and my, my, my other brother, my

16:56.236 --> 17:03.806
older brother, to the synagogue. In Breda. And that was a walk of  oh, I know now where it is,

17:03.806 --> 17:11.295
it was probably fifteen minutes, something like that. And I have, remember some other things.

17:11.295 --> 17:18.623
Eh, going to the synagogue, and I remember very well what the synagogue looked like inside.

17:18.623 --> 17:26.273
I obviously was there, I don't think that I was standing there, politely with everybody else,

17:26.273 --> 17:33.923
was sitting and probably fooled around, sat around, walked around, whatever, eh, but I remember

17:33.923 --> 17:41.251
what the day was.  Which is why I remember exactly what the synagogue looked like, inside.

17:41.251 --> 17:48.820
Eh, the day must have been Yom Kippur. Because on Yom Kippur in the afternoon the  [emotional]

17:48.820 --> 17:53.330
the kohanim, eh, deliver a blessing to the congregation.

17:53.330 --> 17:53.330
Sure

17:54.310 --> 18:02.263
And it's a very weird eh  blessing, song, tune and they put their tallit, their praying shawl

18:02.263 --> 18:09.881
over their heads and all the kohanim with the congregation stand there, in front of the arc

18:09.881 --> 18:16.830
and they say this blessing. And this must have made such a bizarre impression on me

18:16.830 --> 18:18.100
As a small kid

18:18.100 --> 18:22.330
as a small kid, w, and it's still bizarre when you hear it these days

18:22.330 --> 18:22.330
Sure

18:22.330 --> 18:30.188
but I'm not a small kid anymore at all, eh, and it must have been Yom Kippur, 'cause that's

18:30.188 --> 18:38.291
the only time that this is done. And, so I was probably emotionally involved due to which I remember

18:38.291 --> 18:46.555
the inside of that synagogue.  Indeed, eh, some years ago, I think in 2000, that synagogue was redone,

18:46.555 --> 18:54.252
rebuild by the  City of Breda and some other authorities  and I've went to visit it. And as I

18:54.252 --> 19:02.030
walked in, I really didn't have to see much. Because it was identical to the picture I have in

19:02.030 --> 19:09.726
my mind. Identical. And synagogues differ of course. One from the other. But it couldn't have

19:09.726 --> 19:17.666
been anything else and I remember hence from my eh, I was probably f, late f, eh, four, 4Â½, maybe

19:17.666 --> 19:25.850
five, I'm not really sure, I could calculate exactly how m, but just about that, I remember because

19:25.850 --> 19:33.790
of this bizarre event of the eh blessing of the eh, of the, of the kohanim, the priest. I remember

19:33.790 --> 19:41.648
very well eh, this, the, the way that, that synagogue looked. And it still looks like that today,

19:41.648 --> 19:45.700
because it has been re eh redone in  [emotional] .

19:48.710 --> 19:50.710
You tell me when you just want me to stop the camera

19:50.710 --> 19:51.520
It doesn't matter.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.700
Okay.

19:55.670 --> 20:02.356
I remember other things, I remember eh, when the, in the second house I lived, in the h, after the

20:02.356 --> 20:09.247
b, after our house was bombed, eh, that I learned to ride a bike. [emotional] The boys on the street.

20:09.247 --> 20:15.797
Because in front of that house in the Speelhuislaan, there was a very wide, unused, because it,

20:15.797 --> 20:22.484
it, it went to nowhere, sidewalk, and the kids played there and it was actually, eh, quite a broad

20:22.484 --> 20:29.375
street. And eh, very little traffic. And so we bought a bike and I learned to ride a bike. And again,

20:29.375 --> 20:35.925
it's something, it's very important I think psychologists know this very well, some, eh, eh,

20:35.925 --> 20:40.770
if, eh, eh, events in which you are emotionally involved, you remember.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.070
[coughs] absolutely.

20:42.070 --> 20:48.622
And so I remember. So I remember very well. Eh learning to ride a bike. There, and being totally

20:48.622 --> 20:55.311
eh, eh, ecstatic eh riding by myself, they pushed me, pulled me, eh, got to , you got to be going.

20:55.311 --> 21:01.932
And I learned to ride a bike there. What else do I remember? Oh, I remember various other things,

21:01.932 --> 21:08.348
eh, I remember the house we were living in, this is eh, the second house. Eh, like a Dut, like

21:08.348 --> 21:14.969
mo, like many Dutch hou, homes, eh, there are rooms, one after the oth, one, one, on beyo, behind

21:14.969 --> 21:21.385
the other, but blablabla, and then of course, and then there is a passage way and across there

21:21.385 --> 21:27.938
there is a passage to the kitchen and there is a bathroom or whatever. And eh, it obviously was,

21:27.938 --> 21:34.491
eh winter or it was cold and the living rooms, where one ate, eh, of wherever were, were warmed,

21:34.491 --> 21:40.975
but not the corridors and not the bathrooms and so I remember I was afraid, as a little kid, to

21:40.975 --> 21:44.320
cross that dark eh, eh, corridor to the bathroom.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.900
And your sleeping rooms weren't, that

21:46.900 --> 21:49.010
I do not actually remember anything about

21:49.010 --> 21:49.010
warmed

21:49.010 --> 21:50.170
it. Don't remember.

21:50.170 --> 21:50.770
[laughs] Okay.

21:51.950 --> 21:59.677
I have visited those places after eh, n, not all that long ago. And seen them and  eh, it fits,

21:59.677 --> 22:06.999
it fits, it's, actually to me that, to me it's an interesting eh, eh, to me personally

22:06.999 --> 22:14.564
it's an interesting phenomenon how one actually remembers quite clearly eh specific events.

22:14.564 --> 22:22.373
When you're four or five. It's thought that you don't remember anything be eh, much beyond

22:22.373 --> 22:30.182
that, but if you, if you are mostly involved you do. Eh, other events, eh  not really, I, it's

22:30.182 --> 22:37.503
difficult to distinguish if I eh remember events from eh, eh, because I've seen pictures

22:37.503 --> 22:42.709
or talk to my eh, eh, s, only surviving eh, eh sister about that

22:43.200 --> 22:43.960
That

22:43.960 --> 22:45.770
for, because I really remember. What's that?

22:45.770 --> 22:46.850
It's a sister, Bergen op Zoom?

22:46.850 --> 22:53.998
That's right. The other sister also survived.  The sister survived. I mean, there was myself

22:53.998 --> 23:01.374
and it's the other sister and myself, two little ones survived. Eh, my mother and the two other

23:01.374 --> 23:08.827
children were transported to Sobibor, to eh, yeah, well, to eh Westerbork and then from Westerbork

23:08.827 --> 23:15.975
to Vught and from Vught to Westerbork and in the end, eh, it's all beautifully registered by

23:15.975 --> 23:23.124
eh those wonderful Dutch, eh, they helped nicely eh, like eh, hele goeie ambtenaren to eh send

23:23.124 --> 23:29.360
people to their death and eh, in the end they were transported to Sobibor and, and

23:29.360 --> 23:29.360
They were the quite industrious

23:29.360 --> 23:33.290
They were quite industrious, yes, and quite helpful, yeah, right,

23:33.290 --> 23:37.160
eh  that's  Breda, I as such, I have nothing lost in Breda, eh

23:37.160 --> 23:41.300
You haven't told me any memory of your mother

23:46.500 --> 23:54.164
Hardly. I really don't know if, what I remember is a memory or

23:54.164 --> 24:01.590
is induced by pictures I, I have, I've seen, barely, barely.

24:01.620 --> 24:02.070
Hmhm

24:04.780 --> 24:12.973
Eh  not really, vague, vague, vague.  I know some funny, funny customs that

24:12.973 --> 24:20.948
she always liked the chairs around the table in the living room to be set

24:20.948 --> 24:28.050
op de, at an angle to the table, inviting somebody to st, to pull

24:28.050 --> 24:34.482
it back and sit down or something, eh, crazy things like that. Eh, no I actually have

24:34.482 --> 24:40.915
very little memory of that. Eh, too small, not in, emotionally involved, eh, properly

24:40.915 --> 24:46.440
function  I don't know, so there was no emotion, no emotion for, often.

24:46.440 --> 24:52.540
One last question about Breda. Going away, do you remember that moment?

24:52.820 --> 24:54.270
Very well!

24:54.480 --> 24:56.910
That you say goodbye

24:56.910 --> 24:57.480
Oh yes!

24:57.480 --> 24:59.330
You, you were sleeping somewhere else

24:59.460 --> 24:59.910
Oh!

24:59.910 --> 25:00.690
Tell me what

25:00.690 --> 25:07.001
I remember some things I was told.  Eh  yeah, well, you ask

25:07.001 --> 25:13.100
about the mother [grins], it's interesting. [emotional]

25:14.760 --> 25:15.270
Sorry

25:15.270 --> 25:22.257
Eh, sh, I w, I knew very well  that I was a Jewish boy  and she told me that

25:22.257 --> 25:29.336
that's a secret. I keep that to myself. I remember that. I wasn't to tell

25:29.336 --> 25:35.219
anybody. I think she was smart enough to know what was going on.

25:37.120 --> 25:37.380
Hmhm

25:37.380 --> 25:45.016
And eh, she also said that she sent me away, I don't know why also my sister, because I knew how to

25:45.016 --> 25:52.350
shut up.  And she knew when I was four or five that I was somebody who could just keep it inside.

25:52.350 --> 25:53.110
Hmhm

25:53.110 --> 25:59.089
And not say a word.  So there was not much of a danger that I would tell,

25:59.089 --> 26:04.987
that I would, eh have, others participate in my quote secrets and so she

26:04.987 --> 26:10.230
knew that I could do that. But that's it. Nothing beyond that.

26:13.710 --> 26:14.270
Hm

26:14.270 --> 26:19.309
Eh, interestingly, my sister, my, my older sister, who survived, eh was a little

26:19.309 --> 26:24.664
older, a year and a half only, which makes a major difference, because she remembered

26:24.664 --> 26:29.200
much when, she's gone, she's gone now, eh, she remembered much more.

26:29.310 --> 26:29.400
Hm

26:29.400 --> 26:34.190
Much more. And in fact because of that she suffered much more.

26:34.190 --> 26:34.190
Sure.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.640
Much more.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.630
I understand

26:38.630 --> 26:49.597
Eh  in Bergen op Zoom a very interesting, I think that's interesting, eh, these

26:49.597 --> 26:58.940
eh  ladies who worked for there in the Underground [cries] funny huh?

26:58.940 --> 27:00.120
No, it's old memories, painful memories, it, it is very normal

27:00.120 --> 27:03.590
gekraak van papier Anyway, these eh,

27:06.710 --> 27:07.620
If it doesn't bother you

27:07.620 --> 27:07.840
No

27:07.840 --> 27:09.600
it doesn't matter, bother me

27:09.600 --> 27:10.530
Not at all

27:12.090 --> 27:12.250
Okay

27:12.250 --> 27:14.900
Eh,  one has no control of that.

27:14.900 --> 27:19.160
No of course not! [laughs]

27:19.160 --> 27:26.547
These eh two eh  lay sisters, or, or, or, eh, social workers, whatever, eh, eh exchanged

27:26.547 --> 27:33.347
a letter they sent, they allowed my sister and me and I, I did not know where she

27:33.347 --> 27:40.315
was, and my sister, I don't think she knows eh, knew where I was, eh, allowed me,

27:40.315 --> 27:47.619
allowed us to exchange a little letter once eh, twice a year. Every half year. [scrapes

27:47.619 --> 27:52.740
throat] Excuse me. And I actually still have them, have some.

27:54.140 --> 27:54.360
Hm

27:54.360 --> 28:00.771
And I have actually s, I think two of them eh, here, oh, copies and eh  eh  they would

28:00.771 --> 28:07.256
deliver them. They also once or maybe, eh more than once, but I have a letter, at least

28:07.256 --> 28:14.338
one from them who wrote to me 'how are you doing, are you learning well, are you behaving',

28:14.338 --> 28:19.110
blablabla', that sort of stuff. They never signed their names.

28:19.750 --> 28:20.280
Of course not

28:20.280 --> 28:28.017
Of course not eh, eh, I have not, I don't think their letters are even dated, I remember.

28:28.017 --> 28:36.179
Eh, but anyway, eh, so some connection remained but very little.  Eh, after the war  it wasn't

28:36.179 --> 28:44.001
quite clear to the family where I was staying, what to do with me. Because there was nobody!

28:44.001 --> 28:51.823
Really the entire family was so efficiently murdered, eh and eh so first there was an uncle,

28:51.823 --> 28:59.730
but whom I can't talk very much because I don't actually know very much, eh, this was the

28:59.730 --> 29:07.722
only mem, eh, eh, brother of my mother who, with his wife, eh, and two boys, survived the war.

29:07.722 --> 29:15.714
I don't know how or were, eh, for kind of rather irrelevant reasons I never had much contact

29:15.714 --> 29:23.451
with them, but anyway, this was the obvious place for me to go. I went there, they lived in

29:23.451 --> 29:31.528
Amsterdam, you know all of these people coming from, after the war, lived in eh, eh, apartments

29:31.528 --> 29:36.119
that were, or houses, whatever, apartments, taken from

29:37.120 --> 29:37.520
NSB

29:37.520 --> 29:38.190
NSB'ers. Exactly.

29:38.190 --> 29:38.660
Dutch fascists

29:38.660 --> 29:39.430
Yes

29:39.430 --> 29:39.670
Yes

29:39.670 --> 29:48.086
Yep, and [grins], right, and eh, so they lived some place in de Lairessestraat, that was,

29:48.086 --> 29:56.597
we lived at that time and they had decided to, now it's enough, quit Judaism, we are not

29:56.597 --> 30:04.919
Jews anymore. So I don't think it worked very well to become Christian or nothing, eh,

30:04.919 --> 30:13.808
and, anyway, in the process I wa, I was, I was sent there, eh and they eh sent me to a austere

30:13.808 --> 30:20.050
Christian school in Amsterdam-Zuid, very close to the Rijksmuseum.

30:20.290 --> 30:20.740
Hmhm

30:20.740 --> 30:29.085
Eh, Instituut Schreuder, which is evangelical, I'm not really quite sure what, I remember it is,

30:29.085 --> 30:37.686
I was a whi, one year and I hated it. Did I ever hate it! [grins] And it didn't work out f, to, for

30:37.686 --> 30:46.117
me to be with that uncle and eh then, I'm not sure  who the authorities were [emotional] but they

30:46.117 --> 30:54.548
started sending me eh every weekend or every now and, eh, now and then to families in the north and

30:54.548 --> 31:02.894
the east and the south and all, all over, who wanted to eh adopt a child. To, for me to go and see

31:02.894 --> 31:11.239
there would I like it there. And they sent me, I am not sure who it was, eh, to, well, I certainly

31:11.239 --> 31:19.585
remember three, four clearly, where I went eh, by train, eh, they sent me on the t, they got me on

31:19.585 --> 31:28.186
the train and I went there and I, I was collected and spent two, three days in these people's homes

31:28.186 --> 31:36.532
and eh they probably always were very nice, eh, but they weren't my cup of tea. For one thing it

31:36.532 --> 31:45.048
was clear  and that's a leitmotif in my life, it was clear  to me that they were all of course eh,

31:45.048 --> 31:51.350
eh Christian families. And I did not want to become a Christian. That age.

31:51.350 --> 31:55.470
Well you were then, what age, you were ten?

31:55.470 --> 31:58.170
No, no, I was like eh, seven, eight.

31:58.170 --> 31:58.870
That young, ja, sorry

31:58.870 --> 31:59.850
It was quite young

31:59.850 --> 32:00.080
Sorry

32:00.080 --> 32:06.787
It was quite young, yeah, I don't s, ate properly, I don't actually understand it myself.

32:06.787 --> 32:13.639
How come I was so adamant, so somebody must have [grins] put it in my head or told me, probably

32:13.639 --> 32:20.346
my fa, my mother, I don't really know, I don't remember, but I didn't like any of them,

32:20.346 --> 32:25.899
I [laughs] I learn, I learned a lot of stuff. The experience was interesting.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.400
Come on! Seven! [laughs] Experience interesting!

32:28.400 --> 32:32.537
The experience was interesting because I've never had anything like this be, before

32:32.537 --> 32:36.090
[laughs] in that, and then I go back to Bergen op Zoom a few, a few items

32:36.090 --> 32:36.870
Yes please

32:36.870 --> 32:45.223
Because after lunch or dinner, I don't remember, eh, the Bible came on the table and eh the Bible

32:45.223 --> 32:53.999
was read.  So that generally was a, you know eh, f, father and the mother bended and, a women, sometimes

32:53.999 --> 33:02.352
there was a child, sometimes not, in those families, and in some of them the Bible came out and was

33:02.352 --> 33:10.875
read and I have nothing against the Bible nor reading it after dinner or lunch, or dinner it probably

33:10.875 --> 33:19.144
was, but eh, it wasn't my cup of tea. I understood what was going on, njet!  Anyway  eh before I

33:19.144 --> 33:27.414
continue there on the, eh, this, eh, historical relation, eh, eh,  the family I was with in Bergen

33:27.414 --> 33:35.683
op Zoom was, if you wish, a quite simple family in, in that eh, eh, not simple morally, but eh, or

33:35.683 --> 33:41.589
ethically, but eh, the father was a, had been a cook in the Dutch army

33:43.660 --> 33:44.070
Hmhm

33:44.070 --> 33:51.956
eh, Woensdrecht I think, and of course once the Dutch army was eh defeated there was no work, so

33:51.956 --> 34:00.007
he worked all through the war as a waiter in a restaurant where he had to serve beer to the German

34:00.007 --> 34:08.058
soldiers and who knows what, I never came there of course. Eh and eh the family barely scraped by,

34:08.058 --> 34:15.945
it was very difficult. I remember a long period of time, I don't know if it was many months or

34:15.945 --> 34:24.160
months, I do not really know that, probably it was eh, eh, well, it must have been eh through fourt,

34:24.160 --> 34:32.047
'44, that eh we were sent to school in the morning with a piece of bread and some brown sugar.

34:32.047 --> 34:38.620
Period. There just was no, not much to eat. And eh  eh, but anyway, we survived.

34:38.770 --> 34:42.140
Did you get the same share as the other children?

34:42.140 --> 34:42.870
Oh, no doubt about it! Ohohoh

34:42.870 --> 34:44.680
Did they care if you really

34:44.680 --> 34:46.420
There is no doubt about it

34:46.420 --> 34:47.190
No, but they, they cared well for you?

34:47.190 --> 34:55.150
They cared extremely well for me. In fact  I think [emotional] after

34:55.150 --> 35:01.940
the, the eh,  eh  bev, eh, bev, Bevrijding, what is it eh?

35:01.940 --> 35:02.580
Liberation

35:02.580 --> 35:09.698
Anyway, yeah, after Liberation  [emotional] eh, when there was a question, well, what to do

35:09.698 --> 35:17.598
with this kid? They weren't going to keep me and not because they didn't want to, but [emotional]

35:17.598 --> 35:24.951
and  this is hard for me to say, eh, to remember, eh, the mother, moeder Hees told me that eh,

35:24.951 --> 35:32.226
oh, you go back to your people. They weren't going to keep me. They weren't going to make

35:32.226 --> 35:37.780
me Catholic. They knew that's where I would belong, where I belonged.

35:37.780 --> 35:39.370
That's very sweet

35:41.540 --> 35:49.126
Oh pff, because, and how sweet that was, because my sister was with another family, also

35:49.126 --> 35:56.453
Catholic of course, and during the war, no, maybe after the war, I'm not sure, they

35:56.453 --> 36:03.867
had her baptized, in fact, by then she was taken up in the religious activities of the

36:03.867 --> 36:10.160
family to such a degree that I s, think she may have asked to be baptized

36:10.160 --> 36:11.370
Hmhm

36:11.530 --> 36:17.446
and she stayed with them after the war. But that's a different story, we all, we  a little

36:17.446 --> 36:23.427
while. Eh, so that was a major difference. That family was to some degree more sophisticated,

36:23.427 --> 36:29.214
yes, they were more sophisticated, than, the, the very simple family I spent the war with,

36:29.214 --> 36:35.581
relatively simple, eh, I should say and by simple I don't mean anything, anything eh, derogatory,

36:35.581 --> 36:39.889
on the contrary, they obviously were of very high ethical standards

36:39.890 --> 36:39.890
Absolutely

36:39.890 --> 36:39.890
obviously

36:39.890 --> 36:40.390
Did you love them?

36:45.180 --> 36:45.700
What's that?

36:45.700 --> 36:48.730
Did you love your foster mother?

36:49.030 --> 36:54.442
Oh yes!  Oh yes! I mean, after the war, eh, when I was already, it comes in a

36:54.442 --> 37:00.137
moment, in Amsterdam, I, I went there several times a year eh to visit her, visit

37:00.137 --> 37:05.550
her, visit them, visit my sister who stayed in Bergen op Zoom, because I was,

37:05.550 --> 37:10.260
stayed in Amsterdam. Eh, and, oh yes. And it was mutual [emotional]

37:10.260 --> 37:10.260
Wonderful

37:12.740 --> 37:20.487
Anyway  eh with my s, my wondering I didn't want to go here or there, then in the

37:20.487 --> 37:28.328
end, I don't know how, of course everybody was looking for everybody, and a second

37:28.328 --> 37:35.330
cousin of my father eh  eh my grandfather and her grandfather were brothers

37:35.330 --> 37:36.180
Hmhm

37:36.180 --> 37:37.300
found me

37:37.300 --> 37:38.530
Hmhm

37:38.530 --> 37:49.261
invited me over to Amsterdam where they, again lived in a small apartment, had to be, had been occupied

37:49.261 --> 38:00.201
by NSB, NSB-er would be send out, with and, and, eh, eh, chased up, and eh, from the first moment I loved

38:00.201 --> 38:10.933
being there  they eh adopted me and they were my parents for ever, ever after. Until they died. Eh  and

38:10.933 --> 38:21.456
that actually is the beginning of my life. The rest was, to a large degree a mishmash. Yes, I learned

38:21.456 --> 38:30.000
to read and write and arithmetic and various other things, but there was no order.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.300
No, I can imagine!

38:34.570 --> 38:41.766
On my tenth birthday I came to them.  So my first ten years were, well, first year, you know,

38:41.766 --> 38:48.886
very young years, and then at the, eh, my, up till the age of ten was kind of a questionable

38:48.886 --> 38:56.006
situation. A. was I going to be alive or not, B. eh where was I going to be, how was I going

38:56.006 --> 39:02.970
to be and eh, anyway, my tenth birthday. I went to school, public school in Amsterdam  and

39:02.970 --> 39:09.935
that was very good, I had a very good teacher, I remember that very well, for three years,

39:09.935 --> 39:15.430
eh, fourth, fifth, sixth grade and eh learned a lot, no doubt about it.

39:15.430 --> 39:17.750
And that was a different school than the one you were on before?

39:18.230 --> 39:19.510
Oh absolutely.

39:19.510 --> 39:19.510
Okay

39:19.510 --> 39:23.226
Yeah. The school I was before was, yeah, was, sure, it was an openbare

39:23.226 --> 39:26.040
school. Eh, eh, eh, eh, public school. Was very good.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.870
I sometimes ask questions to

39:28.700 --> 39:29.100
Oh do!

39:29.100 --> 39:30.360
make it audible for the others

39:30.890 --> 39:41.593
Yes, of course. Anyway, eh, and here started a very good time. Eh, for me, I mean, time  for, to

39:41.593 --> 39:53.077
actually live. Eh  in the meantime [blows nose]  my parents, quote, unquote, their name was eh Oudkerk,

39:53.077 --> 40:04.561
eh, father well known Dutch Jewish family  eh how then, how that Jewish family was names,  name Oudkerk

40:04.561 --> 40:15.376
is not clear, I have been trying to figure that out but eh, don't really know, eh, they did not

40:15.376 --> 40:26.191
come from Ouderkerk, eh, they came se, apparently some place from Friesland, but they were a long

40:26.191 --> 40:37.007
established Jewish family, there were many members. Anyway, eh, in the meantime, my sister stayed

40:37.007 --> 40:47.822
with the family in Bergen op Zoom, eh  who asked to adopt her. Asked to get, the, the authorities

40:47.822 --> 40:58.637
to adopt her and here comes the [emotional], that's the saddest story of my life [cries] it's

40:58.637 --> 41:05.550
hard to tell  and here comes  the story of Anna Verheij, niet?

41:05.550 --> 41:05.640
Ja.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.830
Jewish Orphans

41:06.830 --> 41:08.750
The Jewish Orphans

41:10.730 --> 41:11.030
It's

41:11.030 --> 41:17.119
my adopting parents wanted to have my sister too. So the two children

41:17.119 --> 41:23.120
could grow up together.  And there was a big, big court case. In the

41:23.120 --> 41:23.780
About your sister?

41:23.780 --> 41:25.160
I'm sorry?

41:25.160 --> 41:26.170
About your sister?

41:26.170 --> 41:31.630
About my sister. I, at the time I didn't know anything about it. Or very, very little.

41:32.080 --> 41:39.423
Let me explain to those who look at the image, eh, the Jewish community

41:39.423 --> 41:46.250
reclaimed children as theirs, and there were many court cases, yes

41:46.250 --> 41:51.552
Oh sure, there were many, many, many. And this was, this was,

41:51.552 --> 41:56.160
this went on, eh, in front of a eh court in Den Bosch

41:56.160 --> 41:56.160
Sure

41:57.620 --> 41:59.830
and of course a, totally

41:59.830 --> 42:01.970
Bergen op Zoom is the jurisdiction of Den

42:01.970 --> 42:01.970
Right

42:01.970 --> 42:01.970
Bosch

42:01.970 --> 42:09.607
Right, totally eh, Catholic eh environment and eh one would think well, well

42:09.607 --> 42:16.340
first of all there was this inclination, was the name Van der Molen

42:16.360 --> 42:17.480
Gesina van der Molen

42:17.480 --> 42:23.755
Van der Molen, ja, there were many people who considered these

42:23.755 --> 42:29.120
Jewish eh, eh children, eh, as pleegch, eh, plicht eh

42:29.120 --> 42:29.120
Foster

42:29.120 --> 42:34.363
foster chi, foster children, even though what they really were was eh, was, was, was children

42:34.363 --> 42:39.719
without their parents. And so they wanted to keep them all, or pushed to keep them all with the

42:39.719 --> 42:45.075
families who had cared for them and had good reasons, there were, there were logically speaking

42:45.075 --> 42:49.529
good reasons for them. But I think there were at least 2,000 of those children.

42:49.570 --> 42:50.320
It's enormous

42:50.320 --> 42:58.414
And the Jewish community wanted them back. Anyway, the following happened. Eh, eh, a well-known

42:58.414 --> 43:04.890
attorney, who was a, a, a, a friend of the Oudkerk family, two  Gerard Polak

43:04.890 --> 43:04.890
Hmhm

43:04.890 --> 43:08.840
You may know the name?

43:08.840 --> 43:10.540
Sure

43:11.080 --> 43:18.915
And he got it so far, that the court I think, I'm not really totally sure about this, got

43:18.915 --> 43:26.664
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, the, the, eh, got the judge to agree to eh, eh face what we would call

43:26.664 --> 43:34.499
a Solomonic judged, jud, eh, justice. Let's get the child and ask her!  My parents wanted

43:34.499 --> 43:42.162
her with us and then I,  them I say that eh, eh, my sister, Roosje, came to visit us two,

43:42.162 --> 43:49.998
three times a year in Amsterdam and I went to visit her in Bergen op Zoom a couple of times

43:49.998 --> 43:58.005
a year, so we knew each other very well, we enjoyed each other very well, we would have grown

43:58.005 --> 44:06.099
up beautifully together, definitely, eh  but she was caught there by, by eh, a family, a very,

44:06.099 --> 44:11.610
ethically very good family, but they wanted to gain the soul for

44:12.030 --> 44:21.519
our Lord, and probably loved her. Well, that is, eh, an interesting story. I'll tell you in a moment.

44:21.519 --> 44:30.640
Eh  so in the court, the court decided to invite the child.  And I'm not sure whether she was in

44:30.640 --> 44:39.946
the courtroom  or if she was observed by a, a eh, a social worker, one of the two, and she was asked:

44:39.946 --> 44:49.251
'do you want to go' but she was asked in the presence, that, my sister told me, so I know, in the

44:49.251 --> 44:58.280
presence of a, her adopting parents. Who had  adopted her. Would you like to go and live with your

44:58.280 --> 45:07.585
brother in Amsterdam, or would you like to stay with us in Bergen op Zoom? The family who had had her

45:07.585 --> 45:16.614
for five years or there about.  And she told me later, she was so afraid  of the terror that would

45:16.614 --> 45:25.643
happen with the family's mother, the Baars family, if she said, had said, oh no I want to go and

45:25.643 --> 45:35.225
live with my brother in Amsterdam  that she says no, I want to stay where I am.  Which was, was a single

45:35.225 --> 45:44.438
sentence, a disaster in her life, because at that time, in the small town of Bergen op Zoom, she was

45:44.438 --> 45:53.559
a smart kid, she went to a eh third class high school, they, she learned to become a, a, [grins]  a

45:53.559 --> 46:02.864
nursing school teacher, one of those high professions, she could have gotten a free profession of any

46:02.864 --> 46:12.262
sort. And it was later obvious that that was the story, but she was in that environment, they didn't

46:12.262 --> 46:21.567
do that, one didn't do that, she went to Catholic schools and the nurses, whom she hated, in short,

46:21.567 --> 46:25.990
she hated her whole life, there. And in fact the

46:25.990 --> 46:27.310
She didn't get the education she could have

46:27.310 --> 46:35.691
and she didn't get the education she cou, she could, could have gotten, eh, there are other

46:35.691 --> 46:44.164
aspects eh to this even, eh, and eh, and eh she, she grew up without me. And I grew up without

46:44.164 --> 46:52.546
her.  Eh  when I see, when I read, and I haven't read Alma Verheij, Verheij, haven't read

46:52.546 --> 47:01.198
the book of, on, on, all, the only recently found out about it, kind of recently, by, by reading

47:01.198 --> 47:09.760
eh Lipschits  eh  the Kleine Shoah, about it and I [grins], I want to get the book and read it,

47:09.760 --> 47:16.340
but eh, I don't need to be told anything about this period. I lived it!

47:16.340 --> 47:21.600
But the choices has been described by Diana Wolff

47:22.410 --> 47:23.480
I don't know that.

47:23.480 --> 47:23.480
That's the name of the book

47:23.480 --> 47:23.480
Really?

47:23.480 --> 47:28.580
Yes. I'll talk about it later

47:28.580 --> 47:31.370
You tell, you give me that, that source please. I'm gonna read it.

47:31.370 --> 47:34.550
I'll give you my review

47:34.550 --> 47:34.800
Good.

47:34.800 --> 47:35.450
[laughs] Okay

47:35.450 --> 47:36.080
Very good.

47:36.490 --> 47:40.780
I wrote it in English, review of it, I'll cut this out with a

47:40.780 --> 47:41.180
Later, good

47:41.180 --> 47:42.350
You'll, you'll be enlightened [laughs]

47:42.350 --> 47:44.470
Very good, very good, very good

47:44.470 --> 47:47.070
I'm a historian [laughs]

47:47.070 --> 47:47.310
And

47:47.310 --> 47:49.610
I'm not a therapist you are talking to [laughs]

47:49.610 --> 47:50.190
What's that?

47:53.070 --> 47:57.710
I'm not a therapist, you're talking to

47:57.710 --> 47:58.920
[laughs]

47:58.920 --> 47:59.020
a historian so I know

47:59.020 --> 47:59.020
Yes

47:59.020 --> 47:59.390
I know

47:59.390 --> 48:01.310
I know the literature

48:01.310 --> 48:01.980
[laughs] Very good. Thank you.

48:01.980 --> 48:01.980
Okay.

48:01.980 --> 48:01.980
So anyway

48:01.980 --> 48:01.980
Continue

48:01.980 --> 48:09.235
So anyway, I li, eh, a real redeeming part of my life was that in 1940, yes

48:09.235 --> 48:16.685
when I came to Amsterdam, in Amsterdam, eh, I was encouraged to, I was  asked

48:16.685 --> 48:22.780
to, suggested to, eh join a Jewish youth federation, Tikwatenoe

48:22.780 --> 48:23.320
Hmhm

48:26.250 --> 48:35.502
and eh, that was great. That was  where I belonged.  And of course I made friends and, and, did all

48:35.502 --> 48:44.660
kinds of things together. I learned about Judaism and about everything else, and eh, eh  I'm not

48:44.660 --> 48:54.193
sure whether the leaders, who were all young men  eh  who were leading us there, then in these groups,

48:54.193 --> 49:03.258
whether they knew of the significance of the work they were doing.  They possibly did, but I can

49:03.258 --> 49:12.324
attest to it that they did very well [emotional] . They did a wonderful job.  Eh, I did a variety

49:12.324 --> 49:21.576
of things at that time, eh, some things of course I will never forget. I don't know what the year

49:21.576 --> 49:30.922
was, it must have been '48 or '49, that for the High Holy days, the eh, Dutch radio had a  maybe

49:30.922 --> 49:40.361
eight minute program about Yom Kippur, eh Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, on the radio, on the official

49:40.361 --> 49:49.613
Dut, on the queen's own radio,  and I sang there eh, I had a little soprano, I sang at a choir of

49:49.613 --> 49:58.865
Tikwatenoe and I eh sang there solo, Awinoe Malkenoe. And of course that was in an recording studio

49:58.865 --> 50:04.659
in, it was live. Eh and of course I will never forget that, eh

50:05.310 --> 50:07.490
You still, still sing it?

50:08.910 --> 50:14.860
[laughs] No [laughs] No, I can sing, but eh, no, I won't [laughs] the

50:14.860 --> 50:21.966
don't, don't challenge me [laughs] I don't have a soprano anymore either.

50:21.966 --> 50:28.802
Eh  and there were other things, for example eh  eh, I with the man who was,

50:28.802 --> 50:34.650
who had that, the youth federation that time was Hans Bloemendal.

50:35.070 --> 50:35.970
Oh!

50:36.210 --> 50:41.950
Who became hoogleraar, professor, eh by chemistry in Nijmegen, he is still alive

50:41.950 --> 50:41.950
Sure

50:41.950 --> 50:51.149
and I, years later, visited him several times in Nijmegen eh, visited him in Amsterdam, in his apartment

50:51.149 --> 51:00.083
in s, in the south eh, Zuid, eh, knew his wife, eh not well, but eh met more than on, more than a few

51:00.083 --> 51:08.840
times, and eh, he at one time, or another decided, oh, let's put it this way, the eh Jewish youth

51:08.840 --> 51:17.597
federation in 1948 got an invitation to send a delegation to congratulate the queen Wilhelmina, now

51:17.597 --> 51:26.708
that's history, for her fiftieth anniversary on the throne. And queen, the queen Wilhelmina received,

51:26.708 --> 51:35.907
I think it was, must have been September '48, received a, all these little delegations to congratulate

51:35.907 --> 51:44.752
her. In the palace on the Dam.  So I was one of two children, there was another little girl, eh, and

51:44.752 --> 51:53.509
then met Hans Bloemendal, en we went actually into the eh area of royalty and we met the queen, eh,

51:53.509 --> 52:02.355
to congratulate her for her fifty years of reign and eh, with the delegation again, with Tikwatenoe.

52:02.355 --> 52:11.377
And there is a, irrelevant but nevertheless significant interesting, [grins], eh, a little event that

52:11.377 --> 52:20.400
happened there, so we were there and we were given tea and we had tea, a little, eh, cups of tea, with

52:20.400 --> 52:29.510
sugar, [grins] and the little girl, I forget her name unfortunately, eh, eh, used to eh, eh, the hunger

52:29.510 --> 52:38.621
in the war, when the tea was up, was drunken, was, was, consumed, she took her little spoon and started

52:38.621 --> 52:41.009
to eat the sugar out of the

52:41.010 --> 52:41.410
I still do

52:41.410 --> 52:42.170
you still do?

52:42.170 --> 52:42.170
[laughs]

52:42.170 --> 52:50.760
Well, they don't do this, I can tell you, on the Paleis on the Dam, because a lady, an eh,

52:50.760 --> 52:52.290
It's bad behavior

52:52.290 --> 52:52.850
attending lady

52:52.850 --> 52:53.820
it's bad behavior

52:53.820 --> 52:59.091
well, let, yes, [laughs], I never forget that, came and said, you, eh, to the little girl whose

52:59.091 --> 53:04.140
name I don't recall, eh, she said, you know something? We don't have to do that anymore

53:04.140 --> 53:08.580
now. Meaning: after the war. And I never forget this, this was very interesting.

53:08.580 --> 53:15.896
And we gave the queen, I wonder where it is, a little Torah scroll, a scroll eh and then

53:15.896 --> 53:23.213
we left the, of course that, that's the end of it. But there were many, many very, eh,

53:23.213 --> 53:30.613
positive events. Eh, during that period in Amsterdam. . Eh  the, my adopting parents, the

53:30.613 --> 53:38.595
family Oudkerk, decided eh, and I was, I heard of this time and again, but fortunately obviously

53:38.595 --> 53:45.995
part of the, the decision, to emigrate to Israel  eh  eh, their friends and acquaintances

53:45.995 --> 53:53.478
after the war eh, all were of the opinion there was no, no future for Jews in Holland, and

53:53.478 --> 53:58.800
even up till today, it's not kind to say to you, or to anybody

53:58.800 --> 53:59.390
Go ahead

53:59.390 --> 54:07.894
yes, yes, yes, I think that maybe they have been right  because what I see, s, living in San Diego today,

54:07.894 --> 54:16.074
where there are, I don't know, 50-60,000 Jews, a major com, community with major community senders,

54:16.074 --> 54:24.416
many, many activities, eh, two dozen congregation of every shade and, and type, eh, very vibrant Jewish

54:24.416 --> 54:32.515
life, which did not exist when I came first to San Diego in 1969. It was very small, there were, eh,

54:32.515 --> 54:40.533
a couple of synagogues,  very small. It has grown like crazy. To see the, and I'll use that word,

54:40.533 --> 54:48.632
the kind of, kind of, I should be careful, pitiful Jewish community in Holland now, that consi, that

54:48.632 --> 54:56.731
thought that there is no future for the Jews in Holland, may to some degree have been right. Whether

54:56.731 --> 55:04.992
it is or isn't is a question of opinion and I would hope that the community, eh the Jewish community

55:04.992 --> 55:13.253
in Holland would grow and thrive to a 120 or 200.000 again. It may, who knows, we cannot eh, eh, I'm

55:13.253 --> 55:21.352
not among the prophets and we don't know. But it is, it is, eh, when I go to Holland and I see the

55:21.352 --> 55:29.614
Jewish community, even though I much enjoyed the meeting here for the, for the eh, with the eh Sobibor

55:29.614 --> 55:38.037
Foundation, eh, with all the people, I enjoyed them very, very much in many ways, eh, and that's what,

55:38.037 --> 55:46.460
this was actually vibrant as such, eh, very active, eh, I don't know how, how, how well eh Dutch Jewry

55:46.460 --> 55:54.478
is doing today. Anyway, it was decided in 1949 we are going to eh, eh, to Israel. We emigrated. But

55:54.478 --> 56:02.577
the Oudkerk's, here, eh, my, my now father and mother, decided in '49 when the war in Israel was

56:02.577 --> 56:10.595
over, the War of Independence was over, to go and have a look. And they left for eh, I don't know

56:10.595 --> 56:18.775
how long, two, three weeks, to see where they're were to gonna go. Do they really want to go there?

56:18.775 --> 56:27.198
It was quite of a backward country at the time, it was really, well, everything was backward. Eh, after

56:27.198 --> 56:35.459
the war it was awful. But eh, they came back and eh decided yes, this is it and on the sixth of March,

56:35.459 --> 56:44.044
1950, we took the first inaugural flight of the KLM  from Schiphol to eh, at the time called Lida Airport.

56:44.044 --> 56:52.224
We arrived there and eh  took the bus I think, yes, I took the bus to a small town Nahariya. Which is

56:52.224 --> 57:00.405
in the north on the coast. North of Haifa. Not far from the Lebanese border and this all by itself is

57:00.405 --> 57:08.585
a very interesting story. Nahariya was established, was non, a non, non-existed piece of land, orange

57:08.585 --> 57:16.846
groves or whatever, eh in the twenties and in the early mid thirties German Jews who were smart enough

57:16.846 --> 57:24.945
to know what was going on, left for Palestine and established a town there. And the town was a eh, a

57:24.945 --> 57:33.125
agricultural town. Nahariya. Along a little, tiny stream, called the Ga'aton and eh, they established

57:33.125 --> 57:41.629
a town, I think at the time we came there, there were 1200 people in the town, eh, pretty, pretty, pretty

57:41.629 --> 57:49.728
nice houses, eh, well organized and eh, eh, the entire town s, spoke not Hebrew  but German.  All my

57:49.728 --> 57:57.989
friends in school were, were, were from German families and in fact all of their families were doctors

57:57.989 --> 58:04.711
and in fact one of my friends was the son of a doctor, doctor, doctor.  Neuberger.-

58:04.550 --> 58:12.692
He had, the man had three doctorates. In law, in this and that, I don't remember in what in all, in

58:12.692 --> 58:20.835
all of what, but, so it was a highly sophisticated community in which I fell to learn. All my friends

58:20.835 --> 58:29.461
were sons and daughters of eh, of eh  eh, the cream of the crop of German Jewry unbelievable, unbelievable.

58:29.461 --> 58:37.523
Eh, I learned a great deal there. I mean, literature and music and philosophy and, you name it, was

58:37.523 --> 58:45.827
daily talk.  Eh, this is what occupied us, schools were good and eh, eh, in fact I remember not too far

58:45.827 --> 58:53.970
from us, a block or two away, there was a house by a, a family, eh doctor Bloch and doctor Bloch was,

58:53.970 --> 59:02.193
of course he is gone by now, or many years, eh, I don't recall from were, was a authority on western

59:02.193 --> 59:10.416
religions and was a professor, I forget where Karlsruhe some place in, in the western, western part of

59:10.416 --> 59:18.478
eh, of Germany, and of course he was smart enough to leave on time and to join eh, there were German

59:18.478 --> 59:26.863
Jews everywhere, but joined Nahariyah and eh, he eh, made a living, or they made a living, by shutteling

59:26.863 --> 59:35.005
the dry cleaning, shirt, jackets and  sheets to a plant in Haifa, eh, thirty kilometers away, eh, and

59:35.005 --> 59:43.228
that was their work. But he was on, but on Sundays, that's one example, on, not  on Shabbat, no, no,

59:43.228 --> 59:51.532
non, we don't, resting day, on, on Shabbat afternoon, they had a kafik lunch and they invited whoever

59:51.532 --> 59:59.836
they could from the community of from outside  and the visitors or whatever and there was a discussion,

59:59.836 --> 01:00:07.898
in German, about some of the most sophisticated ideas of western civilization, or ethics or religion

01:00:07.898 --> 01:00:15.960
or literature or you name it. And after that of course there was coffee and cake. And I attended, eh

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:24.264
I don't know how many, twenty, thirty, forty, who knows how many, mostly those sessions. And this was

01:00:24.264 --> 01:00:32.407
an absolutely incredible situation. That in a place, in which there was nothing but minor agriculture

01:00:32.407 --> 01:00:40.549
and some commerce, eh  eh, there was a, a shabbat meeting or Sunday meeting, weekend meeting, of this

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:48.611
sort! So it was an incredible, eh, environment, in fact an incredible environment to, to grow up in.

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:57.157
The doctor who would see me when I was sick with one thing or the other in that eh small town of Nahariya,

01:00:57.157 --> 01:01:05.219
eh, he had been a doctor in Germany, but for years he had had a grocery store. in Nahariya. How many

01:01:05.219 --> 01:01:13.362
doctors can you have in, can you all be a doctor and take care of each other? No! So anyway, it was a

01:01:13.362 --> 01:01:15.699
very, very interesting place.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.900
I assume not very religious?

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.050
Eh, am I, yes, yes, bit sorry, yes.

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:24.400
I mean, that kind German Jewry

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.030
Yes?

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:26.490
was not terribly religious?

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:28.080
No, was not terribly religious at all. No.

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:28.780
Exactly

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:34.110
Hardly. Hardly. There were, there were religi, no, no, German Jewry was so in, assimilated eh

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.480
What's that?

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:38.590
BÃ¼rgertum

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:46.739
Ja, ja, ja, ja, exactly. Eh, however, the intellectual level of the families and the children who

01:01:46.739 --> 01:01:55.141
were my friends was above and beyond. I have never ever met any, anything like it. Not even eh today

01:01:55.141 --> 01:02:03.795
I'm a, I'm, I'm, eh, part of a university community, eh, significant university of the university

01:02:03.795 --> 01:02:11.945
of California and in San Diego, eh  eh  the l, the intellectual level of our parties eh, eh, with

01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:19.927
our colleagues eh  does not necessarily reach the intellectual level of what went on when I was

01:02:19.927 --> 01:02:28.077
a teenager in Nahariya. Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Quite a few, not too many, but quite a few of

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:36.227
them, after, after the, eh, eh, eh, in the fifties, eh, after the danger had passed, went back to

01:02:36.227 --> 01:02:44.377
Germany, eh  eh  how they did that is not clear to me, but they did. Eh, and I have some friends,

01:02:44.377 --> 01:02:53.031
they don't know I sit here, eh, who were famous professors, my age, eh, v, v, ever since the fifties,

01:02:53.031 --> 01:03:01.349
who studied  mathematics in Hamburg and, and, and, professors of shipbuilding in, in, in, in Bremen

01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:04.709
and who knows where, all over the place.

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:11.670
They were the cream of the crop. And they couldn't stay there forever. And they chose not to go,

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:18.631
well besides the, Germany gave them restitution of  to another, so they had a base to come back to

01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:25.450
in, in Germany. And some went back eh, but it was an absolutely eh, almost Kafkaesque situation.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:28.260
You went to school there?

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:35.532
I went to school there. I finished eh, elementary school and high school, which was very, very good,

01:03:35.532 --> 01:03:42.731
I mean, eh just like Ge, eh, the, Ge, eh, like eh Dutch Jewry wanted its children back. To recreate

01:03:42.731 --> 01:03:49.785
the eh, the eh, the community! Or to have some assets, some, some, some hope of recreating the m,

01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:56.839
community, eh, Israel in its early years, eh, put a lot of effort, there wasn't a lot of money,

01:03:56.839 --> 01:04:04.329
but a lot of effort, significant effort in eh, in the children and so they got the fi, I had the finest

01:04:04.329 --> 01:04:11.601
teachers you can imagine. The finest teachers in, in the, in the early fifties, in elementary school

01:04:11.601 --> 01:04:19.092
which I finished there and then high school. I mean, from ninth grade until twent, twelve, eh, teachers

01:04:19.092 --> 01:04:26.218
who eh, I had a chemistry teacher who was a Russian eh young woman from eh Moscow, eh, who had run

01:04:26.218 --> 01:04:33.709
away during the war years to Shanghai  who got her education in Shanghai and after that came to Israel.

01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:40.981
And she taught me chemistry. I had a eh, a eh math and physics teacher of the same, exactly the same

01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:48.035
sort. He had come to Israel from, again, Shanghai and eh, eh, and they later went on to academics

01:04:48.035 --> 01:04:55.089
eh the academic eh, they had doctorates and went to academic eh positions etcetera, and they were

01:04:55.089 --> 01:05:02.288
my high school teachers. The same in English. I had a teacher who, again, Russian, whom we didn't

01:05:02.288 --> 01:05:09.342
see this at the time, because they came from China of all places, Jews came from China, emigrated

01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:16.614
to Israel and started to teach and they were the finest, the finest I've ever seen, ever met, ever

01:05:16.614 --> 01:05:19.160
seen. Anyway,  eh, in eh, in 1956 I

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.820
would you mind to slow down for a moment?

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:25.020
I will slow down, totally!

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:28.240
Because you rush through history

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.060
I rush through, okay

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:29.270
[laughs]

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:30.170
[laughs] please

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:34.120
And you take five years at a time [laughs]

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.740
[laughs] Yeah, what else? Oh yes, oh, oh, there is a, let's go to a side story.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:39.610
Okay

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:47.310
So I'm living in Nahariya, the small town in Northern Israel, eh  and every year, prox, proximately

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:54.859
every year, eh, we got, the family got some money back, slowly but surely in the late, late forties

01:05:54.859 --> 01:06:02.026
and, in, in, into the fifties, eh, that was money that my f, my parents left behind, eh and eh

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:07.440
so I had, I could and I did eh travel back to Holland to see my sister.

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.950
Hm

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:08.790
And some other

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.290
That was a question which

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:12.120
Came out

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.660
came up in my mind

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:13.800
Yeah

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.040
what happened to your sister

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.200
Where, there is my sister. My sister was in Holland and she

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.040
got eh education and eh, everything was fine as such.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:20.790
So you traveled back to her?

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:28.465
I traveled back to her and eh, eh, at that time, probably what I'm going to, to relate to, eh, and

01:06:28.465 --> 01:06:35.910
I, and I was eh, with that family for a week or two and we went to the beach and did all kinds of

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:43.585
fun things, and you managed very, very well and eh, and that, eh, this was a time eh, that, at that,

01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:51.030
oh, at the time that I was in high school, in Israel, and had really superb teachers, eh, I knew,

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:58.551
I learned a lot. And you do in Israel actually, of history, and eh, ethics and eh, eh, religions I

01:06:58.551 --> 01:07:06.150
shouldn't only say, eh, with Judaism, religions, it was all around, it was, it was of a very high

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:13.748
level. Eh, eh, and so I had knowledge and opinions eh, very much in the, ja, I would say eh Israeli

01:07:13.748 --> 01:07:21.270
eh, eh,  eh  in, let's say in, an intelligent Israeli eh, or, I had, I had knowledge and opinion

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:29.482
of an intelligent Israeli high school student. Okay? And there, we had, eh, my sister and I had significant

01:07:29.482 --> 01:07:36.927
discussions, when I would meet, significant discussions about what is right and what is wrong and

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:44.833
where we came from, what would you do, blablabla, and eh, at one point eh, and we had these discussions

01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:52.508
eh long discussions, many hours, at one point eh, I do not know in response to what, she says 'you

01:07:52.508 --> 01:08:00.106
know I don't know the answer to the question or to that point, go talk to my priest'.  Because,

01:08:00.106 --> 01:08:07.628
in a small town in Holland, in, in Catholic Holland, a priest had a  and all these people were his

01:08:07.628 --> 01:08:15.150
people, his sheep. And she had a priest and apparently she managed very well with that priest. She

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:22.748
was a smart girl and eh, and, and, and priests are often, they often are deviant but, in some ways,

01:08:22.748 --> 01:08:30.346
but in many other ways they are often very smart people. And eh, so she got a lot from him, eh, not

01:08:30.346 --> 01:08:37.868
necessarily on the Catholicism, but also in other ways. And eh, so she told me, in, in response to

01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:45.466
I don't know what question, 'go talk to my priest'. So one day she made an appointment for me

01:08:45.466 --> 01:08:48.230
and I went to see her parish priest.

01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:48.920
Hm

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:55.488
In the church, eh, two blocks away. And I was sitting there, talking to him eh  and I came there, I

01:08:55.488 --> 01:09:02.389
recall it, four in the afternoon and I was there until eleven p.m. At night, 23 hours. Talking, talking,

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:09.024
talking, talking, I don't know if I ate something or not, if I wasn't hungry, I don't know, it

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:15.527
doesn't matter. We had, I had with that priest an incredible, incredible discussion. And what it

01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:22.228
was all about, I do not remember. But I do remember that that priest was too free minded, open minded

01:09:22.228 --> 01:09:28.797
and was replaced to some far away little place later, because he was not really following the lines

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:35.432
of the church. But the result was that the next year, my sister decided to come on a trip to Israel.

01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:42.267
I had been there two, three, four times and she decided, well, what's this, what's my brother doing

01:09:42.267 --> 01:09:46.580
there, what does it look like? And she came on a trip. To Israel.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.890
This, this  supported her to

01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:57.911
I do not know. I do not know.  And eh, so she came to  Israel and we had a wonderful time together

01:09:57.911 --> 01:10:06.841
and we traveled by bus all over the country, it was kind of odious? in some ways, we went to, eh,

01:10:06.841 --> 01:10:15.954
you name it, we went there. Far away. And eh, we slept, in fact, I remember exact, eh, these things

01:10:15.954 --> 01:10:25.160
in, in, in eh monastery, guest houses, in Tiberias and the same in Jerusalem and we went to the Dead

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:33.997
Sea, all kinds of things. And she had a wonderful time. But, vacation was over, she went back to

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:42.927
Holland.  Little did I know that our discussions in Holland and our discussion in Israel and  her

01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:50.200
own need for more  made her, one day, get up and come to Israel!  So here was a

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:50.510
What year

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:51.530
what?

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:52.640
Around which year?

01:10:52.640 --> 01:11:03.193
When, what she really come? Eh  it probably was  the latest fifties or the earliest sixties. I don't

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:12.920
rememb, do not quite remember. Eh and I can look it, I, I know the, of course I can look it up

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.860
Just an indication

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:21.834
She's go, ja, eh, eh, late fifties, earliest six, sixties. And eh, she c, of course came to us, to

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:29.729
me and, of to my, my adopting parents Oudkerk, in Nahariya, and eh she was there, oh, close to half

01:11:29.729 --> 01:11:37.862
a year I think, with us, eh, and she joined my friends, circle of friends, they were wonderful friends

01:11:37.862 --> 01:11:45.757
and eh, we did what everybody does normally, in, I don't remember if she helped in the h, in, in,

01:11:45.757 --> 01:11:53.811
in the household or anything, because I was still, either I was in school or I was already at the eh,

01:11:53.811 --> 01:12:00.590
at the university, I don't remember. Eh, anyway, she eh,  decided to go to an Ulpan

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.740
Hmhm

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:09.449
to study Hebrew and she did and she went to one of these eh, eh, eh, Hebrew studying

01:12:09.449 --> 01:12:17.640
courses in a Kibbutz, in HaShofet, not too far from Haifa and there she met her

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:24.380
future husband and she married and she forgot all about  the Lord

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:24.970
Not the Lord

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:27.550
well not, that Lord, I mean that Lord, that non

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.040
[laughs]

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.456
that, that secondary Lord. And eh learned from her husband, who was Suddo, religious,

01:12:34.456 --> 01:12:41.098
he was religious, he was a, a, he was also a student at the Ulpan, he came from England,

01:12:41.098 --> 01:12:47.439
from London, and they married and had three children and lived eh not ever, not hap,

01:12:47.439 --> 01:12:53.780
happily, but not ever after, because she died in the young, at a young age.  And eh

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:59.139
which I always say is 'bloed kruipt waar het niet gaan kan' [cries]

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.020
Blood goes where

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.660
Well, blood is thicker than water

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.460
Blood is thicker than water

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:09.200
Is what the b, what they say in English

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:09.380
Exactly

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.000
Ja, ja.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.660
Now  how large was this Oudekerk fami, Oudkerk

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.110
Zero. One child.  No more children.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:16.930
You

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:17.550
Me.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.120
You were the only child?

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.250
Yep. They wanted al, eh, eh, also my sister, but they did not have children themselves

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.420
That wasn't clear

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:33.594
Wasn't clear, well, okay, that was it, that was it. Eh they had, they had wanted to have children

01:13:33.594 --> 01:13:40.697
and this has  interesting repercussions eh  they were b, so busy trying to get my sister and busy,

01:13:40.697 --> 01:13:47.799
really means busy, court cases and discussions and who knows what, travel, all that sort of stuff.

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:55.047
Eh, that I think at the p, sudden time they decided eh I think that they eh  eh, had no children and

01:13:55.047 --> 01:14:02.584
probably today could have had children without any difficulty, but me being there eh and the possibility

01:14:02.584 --> 01:14:09.904
being there that eh my sister would also come there, they would have two, they eh kind of decided not

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:15.630
to have any more children of their own. And eh, so that was the family. Period.

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:18.470
Did they create real parental relations?

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:25.020
Yeah, yeah, yes. Eh, eh, yes, even though there it later, later turned out,

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:31.658
which I had not defined, but had obviously felt, that my adopting mother was

01:14:31.658 --> 01:14:37.510
kind of envious of not having eh child, child, children of her own.

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:38.990
Hmhm

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:46.346
But not only for a young child like myself or a young boy or a somewhat older boy, was it very

01:14:46.346 --> 01:14:53.390
traumatic, it was just as traumatic for them. They had lost their whole family [emotional]

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.780
Hmhm

01:14:53.780 --> 01:15:01.320
they had been eh hidden with different families in Amsterdam, was very difficult, they eh

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:08.691
went through the Hungerwinter, eh  didn't know what were, how, there were these awful

01:15:08.691 --> 01:15:16.146
dangers that you picked up and then you're do, you, you done with, eh, you get sent to

01:15:16.146 --> 01:15:22.840
the camps or you get shot right away, eh, eh  eh, people were very traumatized.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.940
And how did the child

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:35.060
By what I now see, and also for, for some time [emotional] as

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:41.480
the inability of the mother to really be a full mother.

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.310
Keeping distance?

01:15:47.510 --> 01:16:00.370
Well, that may well be a Dutch custom anyway. No? Okay. [laughs] No, it isn't. [laughs] Sorry.

01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:00.830
Jewish families?

01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:09.361
No Jewish absolutely not. [laughs] Okay. Yeah. Well, that certainly was, that certainly was what I

01:16:09.361 --> 01:16:18.066
saw.  And keeping distance is a big word and it's hard to interpret to what does this really mean,

01:16:18.066 --> 01:16:27.294
but eh, a lack of, eh, what one calls motherly love  was indeed so. Did they not love me? Oh, he certainly

01:16:27.294 --> 01:16:35.912
did very much and eh, certainly they did. I was totally considered that, their, their, their child,

01:16:35.912 --> 01:16:42.790
no doubt. Eh but eh it never worked as it would have worked with my own mother.

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.790
Sure

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:50.802
It didn't. Now, that is not always so. Is not always so.  Eh, it's not eh, not necessarily eh,

01:16:50.802 --> 01:16:58.979
it, this is not a neces, necessary result, but this was it. This is what so, what's so, and I've

01:16:58.979 --> 01:17:06.910
come to those conclusions way, way later in my life.  Eh  okay, so I was in Israel, eh, my sister

01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:15.005
was in Israel, eh, married now and I went eh, after my eh high school, I had to go the army, but I,

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:22.936
that was a choice to go and study before the army and I was eh very technically inclined, so they

01:17:22.936 --> 01:17:31.112
liked me eh to go to a eh  it's called Atudah, to a eh, it used to be called Atudah, where I could

01:17:31.112 --> 01:17:39.044
first go to the, to, to study and then go and serve in the army. Eh my compulsory service and, so

01:17:39.044 --> 01:17:47.792
I went to the Technion, was accepted and went to the Technion and became an electrical engineer, electrical

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:55.969
engineer.  After which they, the army we could, they of course got me and, and I was in the army for

01:17:55.969 --> 01:18:03.982
three years and worked in my profession basically, not that I didn't see any war or stuff or who

01:18:03.982 --> 01:18:08.969
knows what, but that was basically, that was my, my function.

01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:19.630
And eh  eh, that was very good for me.  Up till today  in America, I meet, of course friends and parents

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:29.543
and grand parents, whatever, of young people who are kind of lost in their purpose in their lives.

01:18:29.543 --> 01:18:39.862
Often their parents are well-to-do, many doctors and professors and you name it, and also non-doctors,

01:18:39.862 --> 01:18:50.281
but many. And eh they still make very good money and their children have been eh, eh raised on a silver

01:18:50.281 --> 01:19:00.599
platter, they never had to do anything and they're lost in, in, eh purpose. They don't really know

01:19:00.599 --> 01:19:10.513
what to do, what they should do with their lives. And I have many example, I know many examples of

01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:20.628
that sort. I mean, maybe I have even a dozen.  And eh  I always tell them, let them go to Israel and

01:19:20.628 --> 01:19:30.744
do something that's not so easy, that will build them.  And some of them fi, indeed have done that

01:19:30.744 --> 01:19:37.320
and find their way into the army, which is  not always fun, which

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:37.320
yes

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.860
is an understatement. What's that?

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.190
It's a tough job

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:46.763
It's often a very tough job, specially, especially in the last ten, ten fifteen years. And eh, but

01:19:46.763 --> 01:19:53.343
it does build the person. It isn't more dangerous than walking the streets of the city. If you look

01:19:53.343 --> 01:19:59.922
at numbers. It is not. Eh so, but people are afraid. Oh, in the army, you know, there are guns there,

01:19:59.922 --> 01:20:05.850
bullets there, it's , sure, people that kill, but people die on the street just the same.

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:10.340
Would you mind very much if I take you back

01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.020
I don't mind at all!

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:16.560
Eh, I want you to talk about your life, but you go

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:16.770
Right

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.870
too  fast sometimes

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:19.920
Yes

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:21.510
Or you want to break for a moment?

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:27.520
No, it doesn't make any difference.  Where would you like to go?

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:36.320
[coughs]. At some stage, you realized your mother was not going to come back

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:36.480
Ah!

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.110
and at some stage you got it confirmed

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:48.450
That's a very interesting question, which I was I actually asked by the judge! Two days ago.

01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:48.450
yes

01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:59.310
And this is a [emotional]  eh, very emotional question.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.500
Sorry

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:14.121
No, no, it's fine. [cries] Can I have some tissues  Nobody ever, ever, told me in matter

01:21:14.121 --> 01:21:27.591
of fact  that my family  immediate family and larder, larger family, had been murdered or

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:41.060
killed or whatever in the war! And just as I probably may not have been  ready or able to

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:53.320
stand that news, they weren't able  to stand or capable of delivering the news.

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:55.250
Or even get it

01:21:56.150 --> 01:22:05.769
Or even get it. But it became very clear, eh, ja, in the late ni, late forties when I, when I went

01:22:05.769 --> 01:22:15.584
to Israel and all that, and did I ever ask myself that specific question: well, gee, will they never

01:22:15.584 --> 01:22:23.830
come back? I probably didn't. And you must have heard this  many times [emotional]

01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.970
Yes

01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:33.108
that I hoped way into my twenties [cries] that there was a mistake and somebody would come back.

01:22:33.108 --> 01:22:42.055
Maybe not into my late twenties, but maybe possibly early twenties. It's something you, you

01:22:42.055 --> 01:22:51.193
hang on to. And  it was obvious, I was inheriting my parents.  There were always lawyers working

01:22:51.193 --> 01:23:00.332
on the numbers and lawyers that pr, the, the, the property of the family, excuse me [blows nose]

01:23:00.332 --> 01:23:09.279
and it was very simple, as simple as two plus two makes four. For me to decide that listen you

01:23:09.279 --> 01:23:18.227
are in, with your sister you are inheriting the whole family, okay, all these lawyers send you

01:23:18.227 --> 01:23:24.509
all these papers, that numbers, and you get some money in the bank

01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:25.490
It was obvious from all those papers you

01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:33.700
as simple as two plus two.  Eh  and one still hopes.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:35.660
Yes

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:45.754
Which probably is  I'm sure  specially after meeting some of the people the last three days here,

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:55.951
that they think had have gone through, and still have thoughts and  trauma's of that period. Which

01:23:55.951 --> 01:24:06.453
are identical to mine's. I think it's just about a, eh syndrome that doesn't differ among people.

01:24:06.453 --> 01:24:16.548
Some of, some of us can tell these stories totally dry,  a little red, eh, but it just [emotional]

01:24:16.548 --> 01:24:24.400
goes the other, the same way. There was this eh, what's his name, Rudie, eh

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:24.660
Cortissos

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.490
You know, the one with the letter.

01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:29.490
Cortissos

01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:39.669
Cor, Cortissos, he is like my brother. I was sitting next to him in court, we sat next one to the other

01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:49.453
and our reactions, and our ways of use, our ways of using eh fun to  for ourselves, cover up things

01:24:49.453 --> 01:24:58.150
that are totally obvious to us, are so similar! It's, looks like he's me! And he's

01:24:58.150 --> 01:24:58.790
We'll talk about

01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:59.700
he says the same.

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:03.270
We'll talk about what happened those days

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.270
Good

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.770
a little later, is that

01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:05.460
Good, sure

01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:08.670
Because I would like to continue with your life story

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:09.410
Sure!

01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:09.920
This is what I

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:09.920
Sure

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.324
No, no, the point, the point, eh, the point I want, I would like to make, the

01:25:14.324 --> 01:25:18.557
point I'm making, in, in getting there, in, in, in  is that I think most

01:25:18.557 --> 01:25:22.390
of the people I've met [emotional] eh go through the same cycles.

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:23.400
Sure

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:26.720
And you should know by now, and you do

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.150
I know

01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:29.260
[grins]

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:29.910
Sorry, I know

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.720
[laughs] and I, I also infer that you do

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.830
is very normal [laughs]

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:35.420
Yeah

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.280
But

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:36.560
So anyway

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.830
but whatever you can read about life cycles and trauma, it's very normal

01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:45.260
Right.  So eh

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:50.760
But then there was a moment

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:57.037
Yeah, actually this is an important point in my life, an important, important eh, di,

01:25:57.037 --> 01:26:03.536
eh direction in my life, eh I was very happy, very happy in 1950 as a thirteen year old,

01:26:03.536 --> 01:26:10.331
I was Bar- Mitzvah in Amsterdam and then we left. Our eh, our goodbye to whoever w, attended

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:15.280
my Bar- Mitzvah, was the, our, my Bar- Mitzvah was a goodbye party.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:15.470
Okay.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:25.451
To my friends, to family, whatever.  And eh, I was very much, very happy to go to, to go to

01:26:25.451 --> 01:26:35.324
Israel. There hÃ¡d to be a break.  And this was a terrific break for me. Not only was life

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:45.525
totally different, you had to relearn eh, you had to basically relearn your life, eh, eh, the

01:26:45.525 --> 01:26:55.507
way things were done and school, the new friends, a newer, eh language and many, many other

01:26:55.507 --> 01:27:05.379
things. Eh and that change plus the eh, eh  plus the realities of life  that early Israel,

01:27:05.379 --> 01:27:15.909
I mean, f, forties, fifties. Eh, imposed on somebody like myself was very good for me. It really

01:27:15.909 --> 01:27:26.550
built me. I don't know how I would have  how I would have developed in Holland without breaking

01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:33.680
with this, basically tragic eh  periods of my ow, of my own life.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:39.500
Just before we go on, I have two questions I really want to ask

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.400
Please

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.330
you. Eh, you went to a public school

01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:45.400
Yes

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:45.850
and the boys were attending your Bar-Mitzvah, were they Jewish, I mean, was

01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:49.060
That was, yes

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:49.140
Eh

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:53.370
Jewish, nobody from school

01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.880
Your friends, were they Jewish or

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.230
Eh, not only, but mostly.

01:27:58.230 --> 01:27:59.110
Mostly Jewish

01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:01.850
Mostly, mostly. Mostly.

01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:10.311
Which brings me to the next question. That period is assumed to be so undesignated

01:28:10.311 --> 01:28:16.400
that it gave rise to a Dutch birth of migration to aliah to

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:16.910
Yep

01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:17.240
Israel

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.050
Yep.

01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:22.020
Eh, have you ever experienced that?

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:29.108
I experienced only one event.  Which was  highly significant in my own little life.  I

01:28:29.108 --> 01:28:36.361
do not remember what it was based on. There were in my, in my public school class, there

01:28:36.361 --> 01:28:43.450
were eh, I don't know, three, maybe four eh Jewish eh pupils and of course, that age

01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:49.549
I don't even know how many Jewish girls I was with, I was not interested

01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:51.870
There were few Jewish children of your age

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.170
There were very few

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:53.440
at all

01:28:53.890 --> 01:28:56.040
but there were, there were, I think I was one of three

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:56.480
If there

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.070
boys

01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:58.630
were your neighborhood [grins]

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:02.875
Yes, I know, it's not quite eh, eh, eh, I w, I rode my bike every morning in the

01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:06.810
cold to school, because my school wasn't there. My school was in, in Zuid.

01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:07.680
Yes

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:11.752
My school actually was very close to the eh, eh, Jacob Obrechtschool, straat,

01:29:11.752 --> 01:29:15.900
I forget what the name of the school was, but it was there. And why they chose,

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.680
why that was chosen for me I don't remember. Probably for that reason.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.370
When I say neighborhood I talk about a bigger circle around

01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:24.480
Yes

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.200
and

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.728
okay, sure, sure, sure, sure, well, in Oost eh, eh, I don't know if eh, eh, I actually

01:29:29.728 --> 01:29:34.463
can't say nothing about it, that, anyway, I was in a school in, in, in the area, generally

01:29:34.463 --> 01:29:39.094
of Zuid and there were three Jewish pupils in my school and I knew them of course, and we,

01:29:39.094 --> 01:29:43.160
we, eh, eh, eh, communicated and my life, my social life really was Tikwatenoe.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:43.820
Okay.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:51.609
Eh, not school. And eh, even though I met, I went to, to, to home, you know, there still was from

01:29:51.609 --> 01:29:58.966
twelve to two, there was a, eh, lunch break at school and often I would go, ate my sandwich or whatever

01:29:58.966 --> 01:30:05.967
I had and I would, will go with one of the friends, they were always Jewish friends, home and have

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:12.824
something to drink there and, and, and eat my eh sandwich and do maybe a little work and then go

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:19.610
back to the school. I couldn't go back to eh, to Mercatorplein. Which is where we lived.  Eh

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:26.611
ja, I remember one, the, there was, there is one eh in my life very, highly significant and there,

01:30:26.611 --> 01:30:33.540
there, some other things on the same level. Highly significant eh events, one in particular, I do

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:40.326
not remember why and how  and what the argument was, eh, but at one point I found myself, find,

01:30:40.326 --> 01:30:47.326
found myself in a big fight with some, obviously, because I remember the comment, comments and the

01:30:47.326 --> 01:30:51.470
remarks, eh, deeply, anti-Semitic eh friends in the class!

01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:52.810
School mates?

01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:53.470
School mates

01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.470
Friends

01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:57.120
Friends is not quite the word, but, yes.

01:30:57.970 --> 01:30:58.980
Okay

01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:08.893
And I eh, eh  I was beaten up  only once.  And I was quite upset and I decided forget it. I took my

01:31:08.893 --> 01:31:18.955
bike and I [grins] rode home. [laughs] And my mother, my adopting mother, saw what was going on, this

01:31:18.955 --> 01:31:29.118
eh, totally eh, upset boy of eh twelve I probably was, eleven, twelve, I don't know when it exactly,

01:31:29.118 --> 01:31:38.782
when it was  and eh, what do you do? Well, when you fall of a ladder  when a window cleaner falls

01:31:38.782 --> 01:31:48.645
of a ladder, if he isn't injured, the only way to, to, to save him from this trauma is to get him

01:31:48.645 --> 01:31:58.508
up the ladder again. Now and then. And the only thing for me was to write a little note and send me

01:31:58.508 --> 01:32:08.471
back to school. So there I went back to school. I give the note to the teacher: where have you been?

01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:18.235
Because it was in, in, in recess, in the middle of a, there was no teacher present, and eh he read

01:32:18.235 --> 01:32:27.899
the note, and then I don't know what he said, he gave a little speech to the class and that was

01:32:27.899 --> 01:32:37.762
it.  But with respect to anti-Semitism  this was a [emotional] sific, significant event in my whole

01:32:37.762 --> 01:32:43.939
life.  I then re, re, what is it, eh, decided or, or, or re eh

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.570
confirmed

01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:55.299
right, then confirmed what I had, I tell you in a moment what that was, what I had decided

01:32:55.299 --> 01:33:06.110
long ago, to never let anybody hurt me. Ever. Again.  And my whole life, this has been a significant

01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:15.839
beacon in my whole life.  Nobody is going to hit, hurt me again.  And anybody who dares to

01:33:15.839 --> 01:33:25.677
do something that is of significance against me, he'll get it back. Anywhere. Just a fist

01:33:25.677 --> 01:33:35.407
in his face. Or whatever the situation. I just won't take it. But there is more to this.

01:33:35.407 --> 01:33:45.136
It didn't hap, it didn't start with eh that class in a public school in Amsterdam.  Eh

01:33:45.136 --> 01:33:55.190
I had received for my, I think fourth birthday, from a neighbor in Breda one of those books,

01:33:55.190 --> 01:34:02.650
it's a long, eh, little children's book with pictures and a story

01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:03.260
yes, which you can unfold, yes

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.990
That's right, like a harmonic. I still have it.

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.720
Harm, harmo

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.180
Like a har

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:08.680
Harmonybook

01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:17.773
I don't know, it, it's, it's, it's one, one big, one big piece of eh soft cardboard

01:34:17.773 --> 01:34:25.711
and there are pictures and you go one or the other and the other side then you read it.

01:34:25.711 --> 01:34:33.558
And it was eh a little, little story about Henkie Haas.  Here, this is eh,  sixty nine

01:34:33.558 --> 01:34:41.314
years later. Now, first of all I have the book, secondly I remember the story. And it

01:34:41.314 --> 01:34:49.161
was very consequential in my life. Has been, I can still , I can say that it still is,

01:34:49.161 --> 01:34:54.910
I have it on my bookshelf. In my bedroom at home! In San Diego.

01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:55.410
Aha

01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:04.924
It tells the story about Henkie Haas, who is a rabbit and he was quietly floating on a little, little

01:35:04.924 --> 01:35:14.188
boat, rowboat and he got stuck in the, in the eh  on the side of the, of the, if the ri, quiet river,

01:35:14.188 --> 01:35:23.361
it was a beautiful day, the birds were singing, blablabla. And he hit the side, he, he slep, he fell

01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:32.809
asleep. And he hit the side of the river, of the canal, whatever. And he got out and apparently  island

01:35:32.809 --> 01:35:41.707
and he was attacked. By  imaginary creatures on two feet. It's a story!  And eh, to not eh, eh,

01:35:41.707 --> 01:35:50.604
spend to much time on this, eh, more and more of these creatures came and tried to attack him and

01:35:50.604 --> 01:35:59.502
they got a hold of him and got him to the chief, to, to the, to, to, to the chief of their tribe,

01:35:59.502 --> 01:36:08.583
whatever, of these funny little yellow creatures and eh, they talked to him and he didn't take it

01:36:08.583 --> 01:36:17.664
and he fought and he got rid of them all, he defended himself, he attacked them, he got back to the

01:36:17.664 --> 01:36:26.836
little boat and he, eh sail off.  That was to me an example then. Because I knew what was happening.

01:36:26.836 --> 01:36:36.101
And I took this little book with me to Bergen op Zoom. It was one of the few things I could take with

01:36:36.101 --> 01:36:45.274
me. And I wrote on it my new name, under which I was hidden in Bergen op Zoom. I still have it. That

01:36:45.274 --> 01:36:54.263
nobody would  play any tricks on me. Whatever. And those are two examples of the same. Nobody will

01:36:54.263 --> 01:37:03.344
hurt me, because I'm going to give them hell.  And it started there with that little children's

01:37:03.344 --> 01:37:06.830
book, that little children's, little

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:07.390
In the middle of the war

01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:14.279
In the, yes, in the war. And it guided me through that whole period, no doubt about it. Of course,

01:37:14.279 --> 01:37:21.239
if there, something had happened,  be taken by the Gestapo or whoever, the police, I would have had

01:37:21.239 --> 01:37:28.198
obviously no f, no, no eh, eh ability to resist any, any of this sort, but for myself, eh, this was

01:37:28.198 --> 01:37:35.088
eh, and has guided me my whole life. And that was the second event that happened to me. Nothing of

01:37:35.088 --> 01:37:41.907
that sort has ever happened to me again. When, they get it back, let's put it that way. [grins]

01:37:41.907 --> 01:37:47.180
Including in academia [grins]. They just get it back. Don't fool with me.

01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:55.750
Did your foster parents  discuss the reason why they wanted to go to Israel?

01:37:55.750 --> 01:38:03.235
I knew, I knew. I was being educated at Tikwatenoe,  here in Amsterdam, eh, and eh, eh, they had friends

01:38:03.235 --> 01:38:10.577
and they have groups of friends with whom they discussed this, so I wa, when they went to, to, to, to,

01:38:10.577 --> 01:38:18.062
for tea or coffee or whatever in the evening to discuss these things, I heard here and there. Of course.

01:38:18.062 --> 01:38:25.260
You have your ears open, eh, children hear, and eh, they, these people had children so you t, talked

01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:31.449
about it. It was, it was eh, highly focused and clear cut. And I wanted it myself too.

01:38:31.450 --> 01:38:33.870
But it was positive?

01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:34.850
Highly positive.

01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:35.330
Not negative troubles?

01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:41.399
Oh no! No, not at that time. No. Even though I heard at that time eh, eh, I remember

01:38:41.399 --> 01:38:46.890
from whom exactly, eh, eh, that, eh, the Jews in Holland have no pe, future.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:47.330
Hmhm

01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:54.846
After that eh, and I told you before, I, I actually I am not so sure that it was wrong. Up till

01:38:54.846 --> 01:39:02.126
today. but that's, that's a, that's a, eh, eh, eh, negative statement eh about Judaism

01:39:02.126 --> 01:39:09.880
in Holland. And indeed, even today many Jews cou, in Holland go to Israel or America or Australia,

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:17.159
New Zealand or whatever.  And I hope that this is, that I'm, that that statement was wrong

01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:24.676
and that what I say now is wrong and that eh the Jewish community in Holland and in Germany and

01:39:24.676 --> 01:39:32.114
in everywhere will thrive again. It may take 200 years, I hope it will, it's not going to be

01:39:32.114 --> 01:39:39.710
soon, no way. No way!  And eh, anyway, this, this gives you a note eh, eh, eh, an idea of, gives

01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:47.147
the tape, whatever, in solid state maybe, an idea of eh  what little, small events in one's

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:54.506
life end in big events in one's life, eh, how they channel wha, channel, have channeled me,

01:39:54.506 --> 01:40:02.022
taught me, into what and who and where I am. Quite actually, quite interesting to think of that

01:40:02.022 --> 01:40:05.900
for myself, looking from the outside onto myself.

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:14.715
So, after high school I went to the, direct, I, I should have gone to the army but instead I went

01:40:14.715 --> 01:40:22.621
to university. I got a, a degree in electrical engineering and I went to the army. I worked in the

01:40:22.621 --> 01:40:30.285
army and that's not particularly significant in, eh, except, yes I did my best eh, but eh, eh

01:40:30.285 --> 01:40:38.030
when I left the army, eh I was now married, eh, I married while I was in the army and I settled

01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:45.694
in, we settled in Jerusalem, where I got a job at the Hebrew University in the medical school.

01:40:45.694 --> 01:40:53.601
As an engineer to work on eh engineering projects in medicine and biology. And I liked that a lot,

01:40:53.601 --> 01:41:01.507
this was certainly a revelation for, for, at, certainly at that time, we are talking nineteen fif,

01:41:01.507 --> 01:41:09.413
nineteen  sixty two/three, eh  eh, engineers eh didn't know anything about biology and medicine,

01:41:09.413 --> 01:41:17.158
eh and eh, eh, however, and, and hence I didn't know anything until I went to work there and I

01:41:17.158 --> 01:41:25.145
found out that there were very interesting things eh, eh, aspects to working in that and I decided,

01:41:25.145 --> 01:41:33.132
I know no medicine, I know no biology, I have to know more and I applied to get a masters now after

01:41:33.132 --> 01:41:40.957
my engineering in what used to be called biophysics or medical physics. And I was accepted to the

01:41:40.957 --> 01:41:44.829
University of California in Berkeley to do that.

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:46.240
Nice place!

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:53.488
Nice place. And very good, it was a group at the time, now it's a department, eh, I went there

01:41:53.488 --> 01:42:01.568
and eh, started my studies, we went there, my wife at the time had eh started the university, microbiology,

01:42:01.568 --> 01:42:08.892
and she finished her degree in Berkeley, did the Masters in microbiology and I started to work on

01:42:08.892 --> 01:42:16.367
the PhD in biophysics as it was called. And that was a very interesting department because it tried

01:42:16.367 --> 01:42:23.767
to unite eh, or to teach the stu, the chemist, chemists physics and, and, and, and biomedicine and

01:42:23.767 --> 01:42:31.092
doctors chemistry and physics and the physicists chemistry and eh, and biomedicine. So they tried

01:42:31.092 --> 01:42:38.416
to make these fields all in one and I was an engineer, eh, quote physicist and eh I would come in

01:42:38.416 --> 01:42:45.740
and learned  chemistry and eh biomedicine and all, all kinds of aspects that are related to that.

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:53.064
Within one semester I saw the light, I dropped everything and restarted biology. Start to [grins]

01:42:53.064 --> 01:42:57.519
courses in basic biology and genetics and human  biogenics

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.600
If you say we, you and your wife?

01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:07.562
Yes, yes, we were there together. Right. And so eh, being now 27, 28, you, you know what is

01:43:07.562 --> 01:43:14.675
important and what isn't and you can eh push off the stuff that appears irrelevant and so

01:43:14.675 --> 01:43:21.787
it took me 3Â½ years to get my PhD in biophysics, but did I do biophysics? I get, my thesis

01:43:21.787 --> 01:43:28.900
was in pure biology. Eh  eh, never mind what the f, what the thesis was like, if you really

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:35.699
want to know you can look it up on the Web, but it's not interested, not interesting.

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.070
How did you meet your wife?

01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:48.561
I'm, oh, interesting! I met my wife eh when a common friend  a girl, a young woman, eh, eh brought

01:43:48.561 --> 01:43:59.367
back a book she had borrowed from me in Nahariya and she had taken a friend of hers who was eh just out

01:43:59.367 --> 01:44:09.859
of the army eh on, on vacation, on, on leave eh, I mean, I have to return a book to this guy and eh,

01:44:09.859 --> 01:44:21.190
come with me.  And there she was and it was klapt in handen then and there. It took a year, we were married.

01:44:21.190 --> 01:44:31.681
Poor young woman friend of mine, it's quite clear that shÃ© was interested and I wasn't and here

01:44:31.681 --> 01:44:40.180
I went and married her, one of her best friends. But these things happen in life.

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.410
Sure. It's normal

01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:45.640
That's what, that's how me, met, met, met my wife.

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.100
Had, had you met many girls before, I mean

01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.140
Oh yeah! I was eh

01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.300
You were interested?

01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:54.300
Eh quite so, quite so.

01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:55.020
[laughs]

01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:00.610
In fact, I had a, these are not relevant stories, but, I had a girlfriend

01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:00.670
you

01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:08.979
Oh, okay, I had a girlfriend in eh, in eh, for, for  two, three years, long time, at least three,

01:45:08.979 --> 01:45:17.020
2Â½ years in high school. And everybody of, each of our friends knew that this is a couple. Except

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:25.061
when high school was over, we were over. [laughs] So, ah, yes, I had eh many girlfriends. Eh, and,

01:45:25.061 --> 01:45:33.021
many steady friends and eh, anyway, we were married and eh, eh, then I got a job in Jerusalem and

01:45:33.021 --> 01:45:40.980
I worked there, went to Berkeley, we went together to Berkeley and we both studied there and eh I

01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:49.021
got a PhD  and eh, before you get your PhD you want to know what I go, what am I going to do after

01:45:49.021 --> 01:45:56.981
that? And I went to visit some acquaintances, some friends at Stanford.  And the acquaintances at

01:45:56.981 --> 01:46:05.186
Stanford, the friends at Stanford, I give it, I gave a talk there as a, as a graduating PhD student,

01:46:05.186 --> 01:46:13.309
where I had a thesis so I had a, something to talk about, I gave a talk there and the students, the

01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:21.269
post-docs told me there is only one lab where you want to go, and we are talking about 1969 , eh,

01:46:21.269 --> 01:46:29.310
you only want to go to the greatest and that's Renato Dulbecco at the Salk Institute in La Jolla

01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:37.269
California, San Diego.  And I, one, oh ja, at the same time, this same man came to give a seminar

01:46:37.269 --> 01:46:45.147
at Berkeley and it was  eh, Stanley Wunwony, and I saw the man, Renato Dulbecco, he was a famous

01:46:45.147 --> 01:46:49.659
scientist, biology scientist in, at the Salk Institute.

01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:56.549
He had come from Italy in eh, eh  after the war? Yes, after, eh, yes, after the war. Or maybe,

01:46:56.549 --> 01:47:03.348
maybe, I don't know, I actually don't know when he came to Coltec, anyway, eh and eh, when

01:47:03.348 --> 01:47:10.002
he was giving his talk, or after he was  I walked up to him and I said, well gee,  eh Doctor

01:47:10.002 --> 01:47:17.018
Dulbecco, blablabla, I would like to in, inquire if I can maybe c, get a post-doc when I graduate

01:47:17.018 --> 01:47:23.890
here. He says, oh yeah, yeah, come to me and we'll talk. So a couple of weeks later I eh flew

01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:30.544
to San Diego and went to talk to this professor,  Dulbecco and eh I was the last post-doc he

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:35.680
was accepting for the next year. But if you're the last, you're in!

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.890
It doesn't matter [laughs]

01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:38.730
Exactly.

01:47:38.730 --> 01:47:40.330
If you are the last or the first

01:47:40.330 --> 01:47:41.360
Exactly!

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:41.590
in

01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:51.184
I was on his list on the wall and that was it. And I did a P, I did a post-doc there, again in a different

01:47:51.184 --> 01:48:00.235
field, I mean, I went for engineering to what basically was microbiology or, not to m, microbiology,

01:48:00.235 --> 01:48:09.196
from there to eh viral work, cancer, viral cancer at the time was 'hot' and eh, I was there for

01:48:09.196 --> 01:48:18.337
2Â½ years and here comes an interesting eh side, side eh, eh, side story, eh I met there, right after

01:48:18.337 --> 01:48:27.751
I came  eh a very famous eh  very special eh German woman who at the time was the right hand of Dolbecko

01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:34.630
but had never had any eh, eh appointment herself, her name was Margaret Vogt

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.150
Hm

01:48:36.150 --> 01:48:43.491
Eh, any biologist eh, unless he is eh 20 or 22 know, knew her at the time, a very accomplished

01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:50.755
scientist and eh we got to like each other or  had the similar outlook and I worked 2Â½ years

01:48:50.755 --> 01:48:58.252
with her on the post-doc. On, on, on work which we published of course. And eh we became friends

01:48:58.252 --> 01:49:05.594
for life. And eh, eh and she will men, she will, she will be part of my life in a moment quite

01:49:05.594 --> 01:49:13.092
a bit more. When I finished my post-doc, we now had two children, one was born early in Berkeley

01:49:13.092 --> 01:49:20.277
and the other was, were born late in Berkeley, one is born in San Francisco and the other in

01:49:20.277 --> 01:49:27.384
Oakland and we went back to Israel. I got a position at the Weizmann Institute in Drachoa.

01:49:27.384 --> 01:49:34.570
And I went there and eh stayed there for close to ten years, working, at the end eh, they, I

01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:41.911
was accepted there in the early seventies, '72, at a time when eh as a result of the Six Day

01:49:41.911 --> 01:49:46.520
War in '67, there was tremendous blooming in the country.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:46.950
Hmhm

01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:53.900
And they accepted eh many dozens of young faculty, at the Weizmann

01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:55.300
Hmhm

01:49:55.300 --> 01:50:02.631
and when time came up, eight years later, or seven, eight years later to give them tenure? they had

01:50:02.631 --> 01:50:09.814
in the year I was supposed to get tenure , there were 27 of us, and they could accept one or two.

01:50:09.814 --> 01:50:16.997
So I was one of two, of two dozen who had to find employment elsewhere and I wasn't going to go

01:50:16.997 --> 01:50:24.328
to, to, to second class institutions, so my friend in San Diego, my Margaret Vogt eh, my mentor and

01:50:24.328 --> 01:50:31.807
friend, colleague eh, with whom I had, had contact because I had been back there on a sabbatical too,

01:50:31.807 --> 01:50:38.991
eh, told me eh come here, we'll find a place of some sort. So I went back there and worked with

01:50:38.991 --> 01:50:46.322
her, the third time, for another year or two and then I looked for a position and got a position at

01:50:46.322 --> 01:50:53.727
the University of California, San Diego. Where I have been ever since.  Eh, we now had a third child

01:50:53.727 --> 01:51:00.910
and eh, my wife worked and I worked as a eh young faculty now at the University of California and

01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:08.167
eh, I knew from eh years prior, many, many people, friends and colleagues and what have you, and I

01:51:08.167 --> 01:51:15.424
was established there completely,  ever since nineteen, well basically eh, eh '87 when I eh, or,

01:51:15.424 --> 01:51:22.756
still from my post-doc in the earliest seventies and eh '87 when I was on a sabbatical. There are

01:51:22.756 --> 01:51:30.235
many, many top  institutions there and I knew almost everybody eh, as things go and I've been there

01:51:30.235 --> 01:51:37.418
ever since. Been teaching and doing research and I've switched fields time and again, eh, which

01:51:37.418 --> 01:51:44.675
I, eh suggest everybody do. Some people, when they retire, they still do what they did as a eh, as

01:51:44.675 --> 01:51:52.154
a st, as a, as a doctoral student and I have changed, I don't know, half a dozen times. And eh have

01:51:52.154 --> 01:51:59.486
enjoyed the process greatly, various aspects of it, knowing something in science nobody else knows,

01:51:59.486 --> 01:52:06.965
is some of the most precious information there is and then publishing it of course and eh, and things

01:52:06.965 --> 01:52:14.518
like that, what it, it's very sweet to the, to the scientific ego. So I love the scientific process,

01:52:14.518 --> 01:52:22.146
I love the students, I've t, taught many, many students, both in large classes and, and PhD students.

01:52:22.146 --> 01:52:24.589
So eh, a typical boring academic.

01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.590
Happy

01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:32.688
Happy, oh yeah. Oh yeah. And eh, and that really has been the beacon in my, in much of my life eh, I

01:52:32.688 --> 01:52:40.622
mean, we're talking ever since eh, eh, Berkeley's in 1990, eh, '64, now I can't count it, it's

01:52:40.622 --> 01:52:48.175
about fifty years right? Okay. So, for fifty years I have had a, a clear light, a clear star there,

01:52:48.175 --> 01:52:56.108
that's what I'm doing. And that's what I've been doing. And eh, so I have many colleague friends

01:52:56.108 --> 01:53:03.661
and non-colleague friends and eh, we're involved, to some degree in the Jewish community and, eh,

01:53:03.661 --> 01:53:11.290
it's good! It's a great place, eh, the, the university or the academic community all together in

01:53:11.290 --> 01:53:19.147
many institutions, not just the university, eh, has grown like a mushroom in quality, also in, in size,

01:53:19.147 --> 01:53:26.700
but in quality, unbelievable. Unbelievable. I mean, I can even see it, it's a, it is as if I have

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:34.252
seen evolution, human evolution occur. Of course it's not evolution I see, I just see that better

01:53:34.252 --> 01:53:41.804
students are being accepted, but eh, in the la, in the, in the thirty years that I've been there,

01:53:41.804 --> 01:53:49.662
I have seen the quality of the students increase, eh, constantly to the effect that eh, I now have some

01:53:49.662 --> 01:53:57.672
undergraduate students in my lab, who are better than the PhD students of twenty years ago. Unbelievable.

01:53:57.672 --> 01:54:05.606
And that's a great, great joy. We talked about this at  Eh, I now eh, I have, I am actually officially

01:54:05.606 --> 01:54:13.387
retired, which is totally, eh, meaningless because I still have the same lab and the same students and

01:54:13.387 --> 01:54:21.016
the same office and I do the same from early till late, but someday soon, especially since I want to

01:54:21.016 --> 01:54:28.797
write a book about this subject [grins], my eight lives, [grins], that I will, I will quit and eh, eh,

01:54:28.797 --> 01:54:36.502
to, to a large degree. Not totally and eh start doing something else, eh, again, yet again. Eh I have

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:44.284
three children. My daughter who was born in Berkeley, eh and got, it's very interesting with respect

01:54:44.284 --> 01:54:51.989
to how people grow up, eh, she got, she's a lovely, was, was a lovely baby bo, baby girl, all girl,

01:54:51.989 --> 01:54:59.617
little young girl, she got all my attention. And the attention of my colleagues and friends and what

01:54:59.617 --> 01:55:07.170
have you, always at the university. First at, first at the Salk Institute, and then at the Weizmann

01:55:07.170 --> 01:55:14.722
Institute where she grew like a mushroom or like a rose, eh, she eh, when she finished high school,

01:55:14.722 --> 01:55:22.351
back and forth in this case in, in, in, in, in San Diego, she went to Harvard, from Harvard she went

01:55:22.351 --> 01:55:30.132
to eh the University of California at San Francisco, she got her MD degree, she had done lots of, lots

01:55:30.132 --> 01:55:37.761
of eh, eh, research at Harvard and at UCSF and eh, she now is food professor eh at the UCSF which is

01:55:37.761 --> 01:55:45.390
roughly like eh going to TÃ¼bingen for, or Heidelberg for physics. I mean it's number, numero uno.

01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:53.095
Eh and she's numero uno, she is a physician and a researcher, has her own lab and it's great and,

01:55:53.095 --> 01:56:00.723
at the same time she's married also to a physician, eh, eh, he's a pathologist and he also has a

01:56:00.723 --> 01:56:08.276
lab and clinical, eh, responsibilities so as far as it's seen from, from the academic eh, eh, di,

01:56:08.276 --> 01:56:16.286
eh, direction nothing could have happened better in this respect. Eh, she has three children. The oldest,

01:56:16.286 --> 01:56:23.915
Jonathan, is nineteen, is in his second year of eh undergraduate studied, studied at Harvard. Number

01:56:23.915 --> 01:56:31.467
two, is just as good and will probably go to Harvard, we don't know quite how to pay for it, but,

01:56:31.467 --> 01:56:31.620
eh

01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:32.450
It's really expensive, yes

01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:40.217
Oh, it's unbelievable [grins] but number two and number three is even better. So  it's great.

01:56:40.217 --> 01:56:48.385
Yeah and my second son, my second child, is a son, Daniel,

01:56:56.232 --> 01:57:04.080
the interview halts for 1 minute

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:12.408
the interview halts for 1 minute

01:57:12.408 --> 01:57:20.255
the interview halts for 1 minute

01:57:20.255 --> 01:57:28.263
the interview halts for 1 minute

01:57:28.263 --> 01:57:36.110
he did a PhD in mathematics, pure mathematics at the

01:57:36.110 --> 01:57:44.038
University of Michigan, which is again the Mecca, one of the Mecca's of mathematics eh, the other

01:57:44.038 --> 01:57:52.606
best one is eh, well, the other good place is, but, is Moscow, I mean, math in Moscow is, eh, is synonymous

01:57:52.606 --> 01:58:00.454
and there are many Russian professors and mathematicians in, in eh, Ann Arbor Michigan, University

01:58:00.454 --> 01:58:08.782
of Michigan. He did PhD there, he then went to work for a large, I mean large space company in Pasadena,

01:58:08.782 --> 01:58:16.549
near California and he's been, been there ever since. And he's doing very well and eh  eh, is

01:58:16.549 --> 01:58:24.717
very, is, is very happy at it. Eh, I have no idea what he does, I can't even understand the language

01:58:24.717 --> 01:58:32.885
they use, I can't even read the books they, they, they, they, they study from. Eh, it's a totally,

01:58:32.885 --> 01:58:40.732
the, there are, you know, multiple languages which they  my eh baby son, Ariel is eh, eh, is early

01:58:40.732 --> 01:58:48.580
thirties, he became a high school eh science teacher and he found a job in a wonderful school, not

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:56.347
far from where I live, eh, we live, and eh, he's married, has one child, so that's grandchild

01:58:56.347 --> 01:59:04.195
number four and in fact  in a moment some other things, side issues, a year and a half ago, in the

01:59:04.195 --> 01:59:12.523
summer of '08 I took my daughter and her, three grandchildren, and my wife and some others eh, because

01:59:12.523 --> 01:59:20.531
the wife I have here, Jo is my second wife, tell you in a moment about that, eh, to Holland. We were

01:59:20.531 --> 01:59:28.698
going to see where eh, eh, daddy, or grand daddy comes from. And we toured the whole country etcetera,

01:59:28.698 --> 01:59:36.706
and we went among others to Breda. And in Breda is a very interesting situation, in that, sure there

01:59:36.706 --> 01:59:44.634
is minute Jewish community but there is a beautiful cemetery. Jewish cemetery. In the woods, a wall

01:59:44.634 --> 01:59:50.960
around it, gorgeous. And my whole family is buried there, except up till 1940.-

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:50.930
Sure

01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:55.974
After 1940 nobody is go, nobody is, have, of course has been buried there from

01:59:55.974 --> 02:00:01.666
my family, or very few people anyway. And they and/or the city or one of the ministries,

02:00:01.666 --> 02:00:05.870
I'm not sure who all contributed, have put up a memorial there.

02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.870
Hm

02:00:06.130 --> 02:00:13.472
Of the people who didn't come back from the Shoah. Of the city of Breda and, and environments.

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:20.662
And it's kind of a, a, a, a shiny eh, eh, eh, memorial standing there with all the names and

02:00:20.662 --> 02:00:28.081
dates of, whether it's a birth and date of eh death. And there are many, many, many Haas, Haas,

02:00:28.081 --> 02:00:35.653
Haas, Haas, Haas, Sobibor, Sobibor, Sobibor, Sobibor.  And my daughter, I was, stood at the graves,

02:00:35.653 --> 02:00:43.072
gravestones, and I didn't see when she did it, my daughter, eh, took her three kids [emotional]

02:00:43.072 --> 02:00:48.350
put them in front of the memorial and took a picture of the memorial.

02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.350
Hmhm

02:00:48.730 --> 02:01:04.280
And her three kids reflect in the memorial.  It's an unbelievable picture. But that's my life.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:04.410
Yes.

02:01:04.410 --> 02:01:11.892
Everybody appreciates it [emotional] but it's very, very interesting. And in fact, when we talk

02:01:11.892 --> 02:01:19.760
about this a little later eh I will come back for various parts of this, the trial and they absolutely

02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:27.320
want to come. They won't let me go without [emotional], will not, they want to come.  So it says

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:33.260
a lot of positive and there is, ja, significant trauma that has come through.

02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:42.690
That's the question I wanted to ask for. All those happy years, what happened with the other side?

02:01:42.690 --> 02:01:52.649
Eh I am quite good  eh, rejecting it.  Avoiding it. And the word is avoidance.

02:01:52.649 --> 02:02:01.460
I do not go on trips to concentration camps or anything of the sort.

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:01.460
Why should you?

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:11.770
Why should I? Yes. I know m, more than I care for. Eh and in doing that I can eh keep it away.

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:13.480
Hm

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:25.086
Because J, I think very significantly, and I'm now looking outside on myself, knowing myself of course.

02:02:25.086 --> 02:02:36.361
I'm not really eh, eh objective in this, because it's me. Nevertheless I can kind of look outside,

02:02:36.361 --> 02:02:47.526
from the outside in, in, onto myself. And  only the last few years  have I found out, and it's only

02:02:47.526 --> 02:02:58.580
a few years and it's mostly due to my wife Jo  that I have for  sixty five years, had an undertone

02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:09.745
of post traumatic stress syndrome.  And I rejected and I don't like to, to eh,  acknowledge it, for

02:03:09.745 --> 02:03:21.020
myself, but there are, there have been uncontrollable, and not, noisy, who knows what eh, of any sort,

02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:32.295
but uncontrollable minor, or major, health issues that results from that, result from that. I've had

02:03:32.295 --> 02:03:43.349
very strange phenomena that I have never been able to understand, eh, since I was a teenager. And it

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:51.640
occurs every year or two or three and whatever. And I know when it happens.

02:03:53.150 --> 02:03:53.280
Hm

02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.060
And all I can do is cure myself by going to sleep.

02:03:59.830 --> 02:04:00.420
Hm

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:06.655
Because no doctor, nothing is wrong with you, what are you talking about?

02:04:06.655 --> 02:04:12.805
In fact, recently  I have come to the conclusion, well, in fact, my wife

02:04:12.805 --> 02:04:17.760
found on the Web  stress syndromes in Holocaust survivors.

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:17.760
Absolute

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.760
And she found in me, and I find in me, exactly those things [emotional].

02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:30.690
Hmhm

02:04:30.690 --> 02:04:40.338
Eh, has it, has it cost me any eh serious problems in my w, in my life? I just told you eh, pretty

02:04:40.338 --> 02:04:49.986
successful eh life, with respect to family and children and eh, and academics and whatever, things

02:04:49.986 --> 02:04:59.240
I like to do, it hasn't. It hasn't. I can really eh, eh, eh, eh, overcome it. But there is

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:09.085
deep down inside [emotional] something that cannot  and it's the first time that I  have embezzled

02:05:09.085 --> 02:05:18.733
that I understand  when soldiers coming back from Vietnam, in the United States,  from, from Iraq,

02:05:18.733 --> 02:05:28.579
but also in Vietnam, but it's too late, too old, too old, and they say they suffer from something.

02:05:28.579 --> 02:05:38.227
And no doctor can find anything.  Not even psychologically.  That they're overcome by hindrances

02:05:38.227 --> 02:05:47.973
that have the strangest physical repercussions, strangest of, that cannot be explained by medicine.

02:05:47.973 --> 02:05:57.425
Nor even by psychology or psychiatry or whatever. Unexplained. And that's a syndrome. And only

02:05:57.425 --> 02:06:01.559
in the last few years can I understand it!

02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:06.710
That you have to admit there is something

02:06:06.710 --> 02:06:09.110
That there is what?

02:06:09.110 --> 02:06:09.720
Something

02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:16.591
Yeah, eh, no doubt, exactly. Exactly. And it's typical and it is, and eh, eh, and

02:06:16.591 --> 02:06:22.970
I think that if you're strong you can, you can circumvent it and eh  and, and

02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.970
Strong?

02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:24.380
and, and avoid it, let's put it that way.

02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:25.510
At one stage your marriage ended, ended?

02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:32.689
Yeah. Then in the eh, oh, in the early sixties, sixties? No, no, no, what am I talking

02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:39.868
about, nonsense, nineties.

02:06:39.868 --> 02:06:46.963
the interview halts for 2 minutes

02:06:46.963 --> 02:06:54.476
the interview halts for 2 minutes

02:06:54.476 --> 02:07:00.320
the interview halts for 2 minutes

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.360
the interview halts for 2 minutes

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:02.760
and starts again at 128 minutes

02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:03.130
the interview halts for 2 minutes

02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:11.509
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:11.509 --> 02:07:19.888
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:19.888 --> 02:07:28.355
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:28.355 --> 02:07:36.821
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:45.462
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:45.462 --> 02:07:52.620
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:54.260
and starts again at 02:08

02:07:54.260 --> 02:08:01.304
and starts again at 02:08

02:08:01.304 --> 02:08:09.141
and starts again at 02:08

02:08:09.141 --> 02:08:16.107
I had my community and my friends and everything, children. And I continued teaching and

02:08:16.107 --> 02:08:23.389
research what have you and then eh, in one way or the other, I found eh, eh, it clicked with

02:08:23.389 --> 02:08:30.513
this young woman who had lost her, her husband many years earlier, eh to, to cancer and eh

02:08:30.513 --> 02:08:35.580
we became close and we married. And it's been a success story.

02:08:35.850 --> 02:08:36.530
Wonderful

02:08:36.890 --> 02:08:43.813
But the, the, eh  I'm quite sure that this was, that the, eh, eh and, and one asks one self, gee,

02:08:43.813 --> 02:08:51.365
why did you do this? Why did you loose, leas, eh leave your wife? Who was the mother of your three children.

02:08:51.365 --> 02:08:58.428
No kidding. It's not a simple thing. And the reason was, it was unbearable. It was just unbearable.

02:08:58.428 --> 02:09:05.562
And, added to that fact is that she refused to see that there was a problem and she refused to see any

02:09:05.562 --> 02:09:12.485
sort of professional help, which I have my doubts if that exists at all. If it can be helped. Maybe

02:09:12.485 --> 02:09:17.869
it can. Hopefully  and I'm probably wrong in this, but I have some opinions

02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:18.710
Is she still alive?

02:09:18.710 --> 02:09:19.080
Oh yes!

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:19.210
Oh

02:09:19.210 --> 02:09:23.075
Alive and, actually alive and well. Alive and well. But

02:09:23.075 --> 02:09:26.870
I have never been sorry that I did it. [grins] In fact

02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:27.940
You want to live, you want to live

02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:30.470
Yeah, exactly. That's indeed for, indeed the point.

02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:34.280
And if you feel you can't live you,

02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:34.360
Couldn't

02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:34.830
Have to,

02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:36.160
couldn't live, because it was

02:09:38.850 --> 02:09:40.670
Yeah. And I've solved

02:09:40.670 --> 02:09:40.860
Eh

02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:43.320
And I solved it

02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:43.860
You had survived already

02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:48.630
I had survived already. And in fact  that word [emotional]

02:09:48.630 --> 02:09:52.250
is a leitmotif in my whole life.  Absolutely

02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:57.020
Sorry. I made a mistake, this is an interpretation of

02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:01.340
you [laughs] that I'm not allowed to make that

02:10:02.190 --> 02:10:03.490
Well,  say anything you want

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:10.560
No, but it's not professional [laughs]

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:10.830
[laughs]

02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:11.990
I'm sorry, I apologize

02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:15.113
Perfectly fine, for me it's perfectly fine eh, you are

02:10:15.113 --> 02:10:17.790
the professional side here, I'm just a person.

02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:19.220
Yeahhhh

02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:19.290
So

02:10:19.290 --> 02:10:20.620
I'm also human

02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:21.110
Yeah, sure.

02:10:21.110 --> 02:10:27.566
This kind of work never is only professional and academic, it's impossible

02:10:27.566 --> 02:10:33.682
and we have to acknowledge that  there are ways of dealing with academia

02:10:33.682 --> 02:10:38.100
and science which are not suited for certain stories

02:10:42.850 --> 02:10:51.921
When one looks at some, at, at, at someone's life, you looking at me, and I'm looking at myself

02:10:51.921 --> 02:11:01.266
telling the story, eh  many of the effects on us  whether it's living in a small town as a, as a eh,

02:11:01.266 --> 02:11:10.338
eh, eh very o, organized person or going through many, many eh, eh difficulties as I have, eh there

02:11:10.338 --> 02:11:19.683
are very many interacting streams and, and streamings and effect, and ef, causing effects, many. Many.

02:11:19.683 --> 02:11:29.396
And some of us survive to the age of 73 or more and some do not. But it's all very, always very complex,

02:11:29.396 --> 02:11:36.359
which of course is the problem of psychologists with p, with their patients.

02:11:36.490 --> 02:11:47.510
Are you eh, still active, eh  how shall I phrase this? I assumed your second wife is not Jewish ?

02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:51.820
She's not Jewish , but she's more Jewish than most of the people around us. [laughs]

02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:52.750
She became Jewish

02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:56.160
No, she doesn't become Jewish , because she couldn't do that to her f, to her parents.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:56.940
Because you said

02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:57.860
And I can understand it.

02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:58.670
you said you

02:11:58.670 --> 02:12:03.435
She, her whole outlook, her all, whole philosophy and all of that, in all

02:12:03.435 --> 02:12:07.810
of these, she's more Jewish than many Jewish people I see, I know

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:07.810
you're loosing

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:07.810
The, by doing

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:07.810
No, no, no, no, that's fine, but you were pulling at it

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:07.810
Oh, yeah, I'm try, I am, on the contrary I'm trying to make sure, yeah okay, okay.

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:07.810
Fine

02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:14.403
Eh, so she's, no she's as such is not Jewish. She has two children who are not Jewish and it

02:12:14.403 --> 02:12:20.996
would be eh, she thinks, she thought, eh kind of forced for her to be Jewish and then not be eh,

02:12:20.996 --> 02:12:27.658
eh, if you wish available to her children. Even though she, she claims she has no religion, which

02:12:27.658 --> 02:12:34.389
is what we saw, eh, eh, she doesn't believe in anything unless it can be klapt touched or proven

02:12:34.389 --> 02:12:40.982
eh [laughs] and eh, which is basically my position as well. And eh, and so we manage very, very,

02:12:40.982 --> 02:12:48.469
very well, so f, so, philosophically or, or, or culturally, or, or sociologically, or, or social-economically

02:12:48.469 --> 02:12:55.131
we see very, very, very much eye to eye. And she participates with me eh, eh, many, not all, many

02:12:55.131 --> 02:13:01.999
of our friends are Jewish and eh, and we go to eh, I mean the person who, who drags me to the Jewish

02:13:01.999 --> 02:13:08.455
Film Festivals in eh San Diego, who has a big one every year in February, eh, is more she than

02:13:08.455 --> 02:13:11.339
the, than I do, and things of that nature.

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:11.960
Hm

02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:19.270
So eh  eh  we have a warm home, we have a Jewish home, we have a, a, eh, eh

02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:25.120
And you were one, at one stage, you said, there was this Madam De Vogt who became

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:25.680
Oh yeah

02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:26.710
more important to your life

02:13:26.710 --> 02:13:27.560
Oh boy!

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:28.420
I'm sorry for my memory

02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:35.894
Oh boy! Thank you for remembering.  This is a side story, has, to some degree nothing to do with

02:13:35.894 --> 02:13:43.446
me or my family, anything like that. Even though she was so closely involved that, it almost, she

02:13:43.446 --> 02:13:50.220
is almost family as such. She is one of two daughters of a very famous German scientist

02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.420
You said so yes

02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:52.320
Oskar Vogt.

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:52.450
Aha

02:13:52.450 --> 02:14:02.426
He was a psychiatrist  eh who was the head of the Kaiser Wilhelm, later

02:14:02.426 --> 02:14:11.700
called Max Planck Institute, for eh  brain research in Berlin-Buch

02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:11.830
Okay

02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:19.847
Northern Berlin.  Eh, he was a very liberal, we were, they were not Jewish , he was a very liberal

02:14:19.847 --> 02:14:27.946
person. He eh became to know, het, an, actually when you think of it,  crazy story, he came to know

02:14:27.946 --> 02:14:36.209
the eh, eh, all the big guys, or many of the big guys, quote, unquote, of Germany in German industry,

02:14:36.209 --> 02:14:44.390
in German everything. Because he was a, he went to work to make some money as a psychiatrist  in the

02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:51.590
Spa's of southern Germany and, there you go. And all these people came. To be treated.

02:14:51.590 --> 02:14:52.340
They also needed help [laughs]

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:55.000
They also, they all needed help, yeah. Okay.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.890
Sorry about laughing

02:14:56.890 --> 02:14:57.520
And he,

02:14:58.150 --> 02:15:05.089
Yeah of course, of course and he made many, many, many, friends and he cured the matron of, and

02:15:05.089 --> 02:15:12.174
here comes something interesting, of the Krupp family, the matron, the mother. And I'm not sure

02:15:12.174 --> 02:15:19.406
how long this goes back. We are talking probably about, eh, she was born in 1850 or 1830, I don't

02:15:19.406 --> 02:15:25.250
know, and we are talking about, about the, the, the, the, the 1910's or 20's

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.400
Yes

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:32.493
10's. And he cured her! of eh mental illness. Or whatever it was. Depression, I'm

02:15:32.493 --> 02:15:39.587
not sure what it was. Never investigated it further. And of course he was the darling

02:15:39.587 --> 02:15:47.014
of the company. Of the, of the family. And the family had some ability  and the following

02:15:47.014 --> 02:15:54.358
happened.  Eh, he eh was now the head of the, well, before that, in the '20's, early

02:15:54.358 --> 02:15:59.950
'20's he's the man who analyzed, totally, the brain of Lenin.

02:15:59.950 --> 02:16:02.700
Yes [grins]

02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:03.420
Okay?

02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:05.600
bizar, I'm sorry [laughs]

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.360
Because what?

02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:07.040
Krupp, Lenin, [laughs]

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:11.203
Well, yeah, here we go! And he went, and he, they asked him to

02:16:11.203 --> 02:16:15.300
establish an institute of brain research in Russia and he did

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:15.430
Yes

02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:18.040
the institute that exists today in Russia

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:18.480
Yes

02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:26.057
are his doing, of course he's gone, he, he died in the '50's, and he had two daughters.

02:16:26.057 --> 02:16:33.634
The bottom line is, this is a long, long, long story and I won't make it for the, all that

02:16:33.634 --> 02:16:41.048
long, he eh was kicked out by Hitler from the chairmanship in 1935-ish of the eh Max Planck

02:16:41.048 --> 02:16:48.951
Institute, eh, or the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for brain research in Berlin-Buch. Hitler didn't

02:16:48.951 --> 02:16:56.609
want him anymore, he was kicked out, but Krupp paid to es, eh millions, to establish a private

02:16:56.609 --> 02:17:02.150
institution to continue this work in eh, near Freiburg. In the Black

02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.260
Yes?

02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:02.650
Forest

02:17:02.650 --> 02:17:03.350
Okay

02:17:03.350 --> 02:17:04.610
Near Freiburg, in Germany.

02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:05.070
Sure

02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:14.658
And it was a big institution, several large buildings and there, with Krupp's money  he constantly

02:17:14.658 --> 02:17:23.478
imported, or had come German Jews, or Russian Jewish scientists, or Czech Jewish scientists,

02:17:23.478 --> 02:17:30.670
or whoever, who went through there and found there other ways to disappear.

02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:30.670
Hmhm

02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:39.097
With Krupp's money!  The Nazi's tried to suppress him, to kill him, to, but

02:17:39.097 --> 02:17:46.555
send him to the concentration camps and I don't know this for sure, but quite

02:17:46.555 --> 02:17:54.485
possibly he picked up the phone to Krupp, one of the Krupp brothers, and they picked

02:17:54.485 --> 02:18:00.810
up the phone to Hitler and said, Herr Hitler, no! Leave Vogt alone.

02:18:01.170 --> 02:18:01.590
Okay

02:18:01.590 --> 02:18:05.761
And he was left alone to do his scientific work, that

02:18:05.761 --> 02:18:09.540
family, in the Black Forest all through the war!

02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:10.960
And he was Jewish?

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:12.020
No!

02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:14.070
Okay.

02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:19.165
But he saved many Jews. After the war, just like there wasn't really a future for,

02:18:19.165 --> 02:18:24.140
I think for Jews in Holland, there was no f, future for liberal people in Germany.

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:24.140
Exactly

02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:31.666
And she left for, or was invited, in fact  unbelievable, p, absolutely unbelievable, during

02:18:31.666 --> 02:18:39.042
the war years, being separated from a, the scientific community, she pa, she, the, Margaret,

02:18:39.042 --> 02:18:47.060
she was a young girl then, eh, say in her twenties, a young woman, published 39 papers in drosophila

02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:54.918
genetics. That were leader, leading papers in the field. In obscure German publications. Published

02:18:54.918 --> 02:19:02.214
on yellow browning paper. Which are available only, eh, I have them all, but available only

02:19:02.214 --> 02:19:10.072
in a few universities because how far was the, were, were scientific papers on drosophila genetics

02:19:10.072 --> 02:19:17.448
send to universities during the Second World War? Well she, by herself, well, there was some

02:19:17.448 --> 02:19:24.824
help of some scientists who came in, geneticists, published 29 papers. And this was known to

02:19:24.824 --> 02:19:32.281
the Fage Group, which is a well-known concept of mostly, among others, German scientists, who

02:19:32.281 --> 02:19:36.050
were working at Koltec in Pasadena, California.

02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:37.280
Hm

02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:45.288
The two  groups who really developed eh, DNA biology or structure of DNA and it's  etcetera,

02:19:45.288 --> 02:19:53.087
were the Pasteur Institute in, P, Paris and in Pasadena, California. There were  many others that

02:19:53.087 --> 02:20:00.887
were pretty good, but they were the top. They invited her over. She came over and started to work

02:20:00.887 --> 02:20:08.526
at Koltec and then eh, eh, eh, started to work with Dulbecco, who was my mentor later, and they

02:20:08.526 --> 02:20:16.406
went and started the Salk Institute with Jonas Salk. Who was the eh developer of the Salk vaccine.

02:20:16.406 --> 02:20:24.044
And eh, of the first Salk vaccine. And eh, highly intelligent woman with whom I have worked. Eh

02:20:24.044 --> 02:20:31.763
on and on, never off since eh, since I came there as a, as a post-doc eh in, at, at the Salk in

02:20:31.763 --> 02:20:39.402
nineteen eh, eh 69.  She died several years ago, I was basically her son and I choose her as my

02:20:39.402 --> 02:20:44.790
scientific mother, this is my fourth mother or something like that.

02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:48.230
A Doctor Mother

02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:55.404
Yeah I think [grins] but, again, again, just like the, the case eh I tell, I tell about eh the, the,

02:20:55.404 --> 02:21:02.506
the place where I landed in Nahariya with all these doctor, doctor, doctor, doctors, with all these

02:21:02.506 --> 02:21:09.608
highly, highly int, eh intelligent and up to date people, eh, who were part of my, of my teenagers,

02:21:09.608 --> 02:21:16.854
she was part of my whole life. I mean, ever since I became a post-doc. And we worked together to, for

02:21:16.854 --> 02:21:24.315
many years, we came very close friends. And I was basically her son. Eh, I know many, many, many stories

02:21:24.315 --> 02:21:31.346
about her and the family etcetera. Eh very famous, I mean, I still get papers, papers, papers from

02:21:31.346 --> 02:21:38.520
Germany sent to me because they knew of the relationship I had with Margaret, eh, eh, about the bio,

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:45.694
the, the, the, eh Max Planck Institute in, in, in, in Berlin-Buch, about the Frankfurt eh collection

02:21:45.694 --> 02:21:52.940
of all of her families, eh brain slides which had been collected in Berlin and in eh, in the eh Black

02:21:52.940 --> 02:22:00.042
Forest and  eh, so another, another eh  highly, highly intelligent, highly regarded eh scientist or

02:22:00.042 --> 02:22:07.216
intellectual in my life eh where I take the second or third, eh third spot. But you cannot but eh be

02:22:07.216 --> 02:22:14.534
effected by people of a stature. She became 94, died a couple of years ago, eh gave her, Jo and I gave

02:22:14.534 --> 02:22:21.636
her lots of support of course in her last, many, many years, but also her last years and eh, eh  so

02:22:21.636 --> 02:22:28.667
one is, when I talk about stories intertwining in ones life, in building a life  it's one of the

02:22:28.667 --> 02:22:35.697
stories. Significant stories. And everybody in San Diego, elsewhere knows this and, and eh, so eh,

02:22:35.697 --> 02:22:42.799
when they, eh, then there is a memorial for Margaret Vogt so anybody, when they ask me if I want to

02:22:42.799 --> 02:22:46.100
participate blablabla, all that sort of stuff.

02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:54.163
It's a very particular world, the academical world of

02:22:54.163 --> 02:23:00.110
German [coughs] before Nazi's and the alternative

02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:01.270
Oh yeah!

02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.500
German intellectuals?

02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:07.697
Oh yes, oh yes! Germany was, and, and then in a moment I'll change my, my, my

02:23:07.697 --> 02:23:13.660
verb, obviously was one of these, eh thÃ© intellectual centers of the world.

02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:15.260
Yes

02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:24.170
Among others due to their highly, highly eh, eh capable Jews, Jewish scientists. And Jewish money

02:23:24.170 --> 02:23:32.712
and Jews scien, eh and Jewish everything. Huh, the twenties eh all of cul, not all of, a good

02:23:32.712 --> 02:23:41.439
part of culture in Germany of, of, of, of, eh, was, was, was Jewish. After the First World War.

02:23:41.439 --> 02:23:49.889
Eh  eh, and in fact here is where I change my verb, eh, Germany has been very much out of my

02:23:49.889 --> 02:23:58.616
system for obvious reasons, for many, many years, eh I am here, we're sitting in Munich here,

02:23:58.616 --> 02:24:07.342
it's the f, actually the first time I come to Germany  and I only allowed myself to come, and

02:24:07.342 --> 02:24:15.793
I am  eh, eh  I agree with myself having come, very much so, not just to the, to the, to the

02:24:15.793 --> 02:24:24.519
trial and the aspects of the f, eh, be, being pursued with the Sobibor Foundation, but also eh,

02:24:24.519 --> 02:24:33.429
we went for six days to, to Berlin, where we went to the musea and what have you  I sense a major

02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:41.880
change in the last half generation only. The last ten, twelve years. In the German attitude

02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:47.299
towards us Jews, and towards their past and towards Israel.

02:24:47.300 --> 02:24:47.300
Hmhm

02:24:48.170 --> 02:24:58.002
Actually, it almost appears, it's not quite so, but it almost appears that the only supporters

02:24:58.002 --> 02:25:07.731
that we as Jews, or Israelis as that, for that matter, have today in the world of consequence,

02:25:07.731 --> 02:25:17.051
are the Germans.  And what we have noticed here with  the people of the court, I mean, sure

02:25:17.051 --> 02:25:26.167
they're eh public servants, including as I see it, the judges and the attorneys,  eh is

02:25:26.167 --> 02:25:35.487
evidence of this major change. And it is an extreme position for somebody like me with this

02:25:35.487 --> 02:25:41.529
history we just try to record it.  To this sadist now here.

02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:43.600
Before we go over to the

02:25:44.050 --> 02:25:45.110
Ja

02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.430
[coughs]

02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:45.570
trial

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:46.150
trial

02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.320
Yeah

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:58.450
I, I keep myself to chronologies,  is there anything you forgot to talk, to tell?

02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:10.500
Just think

02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:19.914
Not really eh  of any consequence, only, only maybe, maybe some summaries of, of my life. Very personal

02:26:19.914 --> 02:26:28.871
unfortunately, eh  I've, I, in fact intend, as I already told you to write a book about my eight

02:26:28.871 --> 02:26:38.194
lives, and they're all different. Very different, in many ways. Eh  but eh  one common, as I already

02:26:38.194 --> 02:26:47.883
said before, leitmotif is, and I know of instances that I'm not sure if you, you'll ask me immediately

02:26:47.883 --> 02:26:56.931
well, tell me an incident, but I'm not sure if I can, eh that surviving , just surviving and then

02:26:56.931 --> 02:27:05.888
doing what I, I'm able to do in this world, eh have been a highly significant eh  eh motif in my

02:27:05.888 --> 02:27:14.937
life. On different, eh, on, on, on, on, from, from different sides. And this is during army service

02:27:14.937 --> 02:27:23.894
and this is eh being careful not to fall into a deep hole, what, whatever you wish to, to, to talk

02:27:23.894 --> 02:27:32.852
about. Eh and that is obviously due, due to my past. That's number one. Number two, as I already

02:27:32.852 --> 02:27:41.809
quoted, and I just repeat myself now, I'll try to repeat it more interestingly, eh  eh,  this is

02:27:41.809 --> 02:27:51.498
where my Israeli education, with army, without army is irrelevant, irrelevant, has been very consequential

02:27:51.498 --> 02:28:00.546
to me. In my life.  And it's exactly the little story I told you about this eh Henkie Haas, about

02:28:00.546 --> 02:28:10.143
this eh, I just won't let anybody hurt me or us  I will  I will eh work hard, hit hard eh do everything

02:28:10.143 --> 02:28:19.283
I can to make sure that we, and I get our rights, that we deserve. And that's really the leitmotif

02:28:19.283 --> 02:28:28.241
of my life. Have nothing to do with academia, have nothing to do with learning, have nothing to do

02:28:28.241 --> 02:28:37.198
with if I did okay in high school or not, nothing of the sort. But at every point, at every step I

02:28:37.198 --> 02:28:46.704
recognize that this has been a very important eh aspect which others who ha, do not have the experience,

02:28:46.704 --> 02:28:55.935
experiences that I've been through, may not ever come in, can come to touch or come in, in, in, in,

02:28:55.935 --> 02:29:05.532
in contact with. And there are no significant eh, really significant points that I, we haven't managed,

02:29:05.532 --> 02:29:14.947
or there are many of, stories, stories, but no, nothing of, to a significance eh beyond that. Eh except

02:29:14.947 --> 02:29:24.087
one point.  eh, this is probably the result of my life or the result of my genetics, my inheritance,

02:29:24.087 --> 02:29:33.410
whatever. Eh  at this point in my life I ha, the last five, six years, I've been working on prostate

02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:34.050
cancer.

02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:37.130
Hmhm

02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:46.948
Eh, why prostate cancer? Never mind. Eh, I could have chosen breast cancer or something similar. It's

02:29:46.948 --> 02:29:57.338
all very much the same. In which eh science and medicine and biomedicine eh  are actually quite unsuccessful.

02:29:57.338 --> 02:30:07.156
And there are major questions there that need to be answered and the scientific establishment doesn't

02:30:07.156 --> 02:30:16.498
allow, doesn't facilitate people to go through or to, to, to, to research or to come up with new

02:30:16.498 --> 02:30:25.745
ideas of what needs to be done. But I've been to many meetings of course and, and, and granting

02:30:25.745 --> 02:30:35.086
agencies and what have you, and you see people who eh have prostate cancer and are scared to death

02:30:35.086 --> 02:30:44.333
that in six, seven, eight months they'll die. And the same is breast cancer. And others. Eh the

02:30:44.333 --> 02:30:53.674
possibility, the opportunity I should use the word, to serve human kind with that sort of work  is

02:30:53.674 --> 02:31:03.302
the center of my being. Period. It is, yeah, highly satisfying to a person like myself but it is also

02:31:03.302 --> 02:31:08.450
almost a purpose in life, in my life at this point. Eh

02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:09.520
It's worth it

02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:14.199
It's be, besides the fact that it may well be worth it, worth,

02:31:14.199 --> 02:31:17.920
worth it, eh, it is the only way I can express myself.

02:31:19.420 --> 02:31:34.020
I understand.  Till now I want to thank you and we will break and then we will continue.

02:31:34.180 --> 02:31:35.770
Good. Thank you. Thank you.

02:31:35.770 --> 02:31:35.997
Ik wil je vragen, ik wil je vragen Martin, () waarom heb je besloten

02:31:35.997 --> 02:31:36.225
mee te doen aan de rol als de groep medeklager, mede, NebenklÃ¤gers,

02:31:36.225 --> 02:31:36.440
bij het proces Demjanjuk en hoe ben je ermee in contact gekomen?

02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:42.470
Ten eerste, in Hollands nu?

02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:44.170
Nou je ku, o sorry

02:31:44.170 --> 02:31:46.560
We can, we can

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:50.778
Oh I, I want to ask you eh how, how did you decide to join the Nebenklager, how

02:31:50.778 --> 02:31:54.570
did you get into contact and what are your motivations? I, I apologize.

02:31:59.110 --> 02:32:07.718
I saw a small, a very small, little article online in the Jerusalem Post

02:32:07.718 --> 02:32:15.250
[scrapes throat] that eh  eh Houwink, Houwink ten Cate, Houwink

02:32:15.250 --> 02:32:16.850
Ten Cate, ja

02:32:17.430 --> 02:32:20.840
Ten Cate was organizing something of this nature

02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:21.780
Hmhm?

02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:32.178
and eh that there would be a, if, if Demjanjuk was to be extradited eh this would happen in Munich,

02:32:32.178 --> 02:32:42.261
because the eh, the judiciary here, in, in, in Munich eh in Germany was interested to, to pursue

02:32:42.261 --> 02:32:51.820
this case. And it probably took me  eh fifteen milliseconds  to decide that this is for me.

02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:52.550
Hmhm

02:32:52.550 --> 02:33:01.257
I didn't even think for a moment [scrapes throat]. I had to do this. And one of the main reasons or,

02:33:01.257 --> 02:33:09.794
or, eh, arguments that I told myself was how would my, sorry, even though a NebenklÃ¤ger can only be

02:33:09.794 --> 02:33:18.245
Neben, NebenklÃ¤ger according to German law if it is immediate next of kin who was the vic, who was

02:33:18.245 --> 02:33:26.867
the actual murder victim [scrapes throat] there are so many people killed of my family in Sobibor and

02:33:26.867 --> 02:33:35.575
elsewhere  that to be specific  what would my mother think or have thought and my murdered brother and

02:33:35.575 --> 02:33:44.112
my gassed sister? If the only survivor of the immediate family wasn't going to put in  the action,

02:33:44.112 --> 02:33:52.819
the effort to go there and, quote, de, defend them or eh recognize them or remember them? And that's

02:33:52.819 --> 02:34:01.270
the main reason. It is absolutely right for me to do that [scrapes throat] to do that, to have done

02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:10.063
it, and I continue more and in fact I'll come at least probably twice more, I want to hear, be heard,

02:34:10.063 --> 02:34:18.600
discuss, etcetera and there are many reasons for that. So that's where I heard it and that's the

02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:27.649
main reason I came. It is [scrapes throat] and this is actually, there is some, something more interesting

02:34:27.649 --> 02:34:36.100
than that, or more relevant to that and that, for years eh, for example, I, I have, I have eh, kept

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:45.149
myself from doing anything of this nature for many years, when the case was being heard in Israel [scrapes

02:34:45.149 --> 02:34:53.857
throat] the Demjanjuk case, I barely, if at all, listened to details of the, of the trial. It didn't

02:34:53.857 --> 02:35:02.394
interest me at all. No, I must say I did not know at the time that some of, next of kin of mine, had

02:35:02.394 --> 02:35:10.845
been killed in, in eh, in Sobibor.Did not know. Only at the end of the nineties did I ef, did I get

02:35:10.845 --> 02:35:19.638
a, a letter from the, the, from the eh Dutch Red Cross stating all these exact details, dates and, and,

02:35:19.638 --> 02:35:28.858
and places. I didn't know.  Eh  and in fact they wouldn't, they meaning the Dutch, the Dutch government,

02:35:28.858 --> 02:35:37.736
the Dutch eh, the Red Cross, would not voluntarily let me look in, look into the eh, into those sources.

02:35:37.736 --> 02:35:38.590
Into those

02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:46.644
lists. I had to ask. But I came, the, eh, in the lite, late nineties there was a eh, a call for people

02:35:46.644 --> 02:35:54.383
to, to inquire and then they would eh, eh research it and send us a letter with all these details.

02:35:54.383 --> 02:36:02.200
That's what I did. So anyway, I didn't know. Eh  and I actually avoided it for a long time, for

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:10.334
all the same reasons of self-preservation. For all of those reasons. In fact, I'm sure you've heard

02:36:10.334 --> 02:36:18.389
this many times, and it's on many of the other tapes, eh, of these interviews,  I was to some degree

02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:26.285
disgusted with the whole thing. I didn't want to hear of it. Because there was nothing to be done,

02:36:26.285 --> 02:36:34.340
it was beastly, it was criminal in the lower, in the lowest form and eh nobody was going to come back,

02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:39.710
it wouldn't help anything or anyone. And, I could barely stand it.

02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.710
Hmhm

02:36:41.330 --> 02:36:48.792
But this has changed for two reasons. One: I now know where those murders took

02:36:48.792 --> 02:36:56.350
place [scrapes throat], two: I have s, I have seen already for the last eh, eh,

02:36:56.350 --> 02:37:03.908
recently few, recently  I think ten, twelve years, especially in the last four,

02:37:03.908 --> 02:37:10.510
five, that there has been a significant change in the German attitude

02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.510
Hmhm

02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.200
towards the Shoah

02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:12.200
Hmhm

02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:22.440
eh, in their attitude towards me, in the attitude towards, and I'm not talking about single Germans,

02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:31.912
there were always eh fine single Germans, I have some German friends in, in San Diego, which is something

02:37:31.912 --> 02:37:40.933
I'll talk to, eh I have to tell you about on tape, but eh  eh the German, current German attitude,

02:37:40.933 --> 02:37:50.043
the last dozen years, towards Israel, maybe I repeat myself, towards the Jews and towards eh, eh, the

02:37:50.043 --> 02:37:59.244
Shoah, the Holocaust, are of a nature that they are in my eyes not thinking too f, too, too theo, too,

02:37:59.244 --> 02:38:08.355
too thoroughly about that, they had, about the only ones who have thoroughly repented  and atoned for

02:38:08.355 --> 02:38:17.737
the crimes of their grandparents. I think they have. And in fact, the attitude we have seen during these

02:38:17.737 --> 02:38:23.420
days in Munich  is ju, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, emphasizes that.

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:23.610
Can you explain that?

02:38:23.610 --> 02:38:32.796
Yeah. The eh, eh, the people in the court, the eh, people in the hotel, you know many of

02:38:32.796 --> 02:38:42.923
them are not German, eh, the people on the street, eh, I've, I, not only do I find no animosity

02:38:42.923 --> 02:38:52.110
towards me when I walk in or do whatever I do, I find actually support and the, the, the

02:38:52.110 --> 02:39:01.401
eh, the eh, eh people in the court, including the judges, not to talk at all eh about the

02:39:01.401 --> 02:39:10.693
eh, the lawyers who of course chose to do this out of conviction, eh, eh they are such a,

02:39:10.693 --> 02:39:18.210
eh, breath of fresh wind in a highly negative situation ever since '45

02:39:18.730 --> 02:39:19.400
Hm

02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:27.755
that how can I allow myself, and I cannot, and I don't want to, to not recognize their effort.

02:39:27.755 --> 02:39:35.936
It would be an absolute historical mistake, I think, for us not to go towards them and say yes

02:39:35.936 --> 02:39:44.118
we accept your atonement. Do we forget? No! Are we less sad about it because of it? Because of

02:39:44.118 --> 02:39:52.647
these atrocities and our own families going down the drain? Or  going eh up in smoke? No! But they

02:39:52.647 --> 02:40:01.089
have drawn the conclusions and in fact, the Germans, the current German generation, has drawn the

02:40:01.089 --> 02:40:09.445
conclusions, in comparison, many other German gene, eh, eh, I'm sorry, many other perpetrators

02:40:09.445 --> 02:40:17.626
of hanes crimes, eh crimes, have not  Take Japan.  The Japanese  eh committed eh if you on, if

02:40:17.626 --> 02:40:26.069
one knows a little history,  crimes as hanes as, as, as, as, as the Nazi's, just no doubt about

02:40:26.069 --> 02:40:34.337
it, all over this East Asia and China, and the Chinese hate them for all the right reasons, and

02:40:34.337 --> 02:40:40.430
they have never been able to atone even in the smallest way publically

02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:42.380
Hmhm I know

02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:51.268
nor have the Americans atoned for the, eh, eh, destruction of native life in the United States,

02:40:51.268 --> 02:40:59.603
nor for terrible repeated crimes against the blacks, whom they imported themselves eh, to become

02:40:59.603 --> 02:41:08.025
slaves. Eh  but the Germans have.  Or are clearly in the process. And that including eh, eh, very

02:41:08.025 --> 02:41:16.273
sw, eh, very, eh, eh soft spot I have, for obvious reasons, for Israel, and not necessarily for

02:41:16.273 --> 02:41:24.781
every policy they pursue, but I have a very spot for, a very soft spot for Israel, and the Germans

02:41:24.781 --> 02:41:31.119
are about the only ones who are eh, almost eh unconditionally supportive.

02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:31.120
Hmhm

02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:34.630
Now it is wrong to be unconditionally supportive, politically

02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:35.510
Is that so? [laughs]

02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:42.555
Yes, it is. However, eh, eh, they are very supportive. And for all the reasons that I, I imagine

02:41:42.555 --> 02:41:49.380
what goes through them when they decide on one other,  decision, however, it shows, it really

02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:56.132
shows, clearly, when we visit here, so [scrapes throat] I had to come, there were, was every

02:41:56.132 --> 02:42:01.710
possible reason for me to come, I'm happy I came and it was right to come.

02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:08.051
So what happened to you those days of the trial? Because we

02:42:08.051 --> 02:42:13.450
were together at the first days of the trial Demjanjuk.

02:42:13.450 --> 02:42:15.240
You like to hear about Demjanjuk or about the

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:15.240
You

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:16.350
group? Me?

02:42:16.350 --> 02:42:19.320
Me or your relation to the other Nebenanklager

02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:20.520
Ah! Oh my gosh!

02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:20.930
What happened

02:42:20.930 --> 02:42:22.480
Oh my gosh! How interes

02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:22.840
What happened

02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:23.510
How interesting

02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:24.760
to you?

02:42:25.810 --> 02:42:28.890
What happened to me first of all, within the group

02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:30.770
Of NebenklÃ¤ger huh?

02:42:30.770 --> 02:42:34.990
of NebenklÃ¤ger, the group of s, eh, eh, of, brought here by the Sobibor Foundation

02:42:34.990 --> 02:42:34.990
Yes

02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:43.399
eh, is that I saw, hey gee, I'm not alone!  Not only am I not alone, they are all so similar to me

02:42:43.399 --> 02:42:51.443
in their past, in their eh, eh, smaller or bigger, bigger traumas, in their reactions to these traumas,

02:42:51.443 --> 02:42:59.252
in their, I mean eh, one in par, eh, happened to sit next to him, Rudie, eh [scrapes throat] his eh,

02:42:59.252 --> 02:43:07.218
we have, we, we were joking, we were, eh, talking to each other, eh  eh, quietly, politely, eh in the,

02:43:07.218 --> 02:43:14.949
eh the, in the, eh court chambers, eh, in the, in the hall, eh, we had comments to each other about

02:43:14.949 --> 02:43:22.914
Demjanjuk and about the judge and about the, the, the cour, the, the procedures and what have you, and

02:43:22.914 --> 02:43:30.802
we thought so much the same! I thought: he's my brother!  Identical. And I know, of course I talked

02:43:30.802 --> 02:43:38.611
eh with him, not, not enough but, eh, that he thought, thought exactly the same. We are so similar I

02:43:38.611 --> 02:43:46.577
can't even believe it. But there are many others who have very similar ideas. Few of the people here

02:43:46.577 --> 02:43:54.777
were hateful, I don't think many were, if any, I'm not sure. There was no thoughts of revenge against

02:43:54.777 --> 02:44:02.508
this old man. After all, is he a criminal? laughs sceptisch You bet he is! And how! And we'll see

02:44:02.508 --> 02:44:10.474
if the court proves that to the satis, to its satisfaction. We'll wait and see. I think, he did what

02:44:10.474 --> 02:44:18.283
he did, it was actually ju, just about proven in, in, in the cou, in the case in Israel and that's

02:44:18.283 --> 02:44:26.249
not, not necessarily relevant. Do I [scrapes throat], did I get eh red in the face and, and, and, and,

02:44:26.249 --> 02:44:34.058
and eh, did I eh, eh, did a lot of animosity come up, come up in me when I saw this man? Not at all.

02:44:34.058 --> 02:44:41.789
I think he is a pathetic eh, eh, eh, anti-hero. He's nothing! Which is exactly why he did what he

02:44:41.789 --> 02:44:50.302
did. If he were a Mensch, even though he was 21 or whatever he was, 22, he would have run away, he wouldn't

02:44:50.302 --> 02:44:58.033
have done this. But he is a pathetic, little mouse. I can't even call, call him a rat. A pathetic

02:44:58.033 --> 02:45:05.764
nothing. He won't even sit up and look the court, the lawyers or us the NebenklÃ¤ger in the eye!

02:45:05.764 --> 02:45:13.495
So he in the court, in the case to me has become irrelevant. Yes, he has to be eh punished, but his

02:45:13.495 --> 02:45:21.695
punishment will be when it comes, by the hand of the Almighty, he, he'll die. Eh, and he, most probably

02:45:21.695 --> 02:45:29.817
will die in jail, there is, b, barely a change that he will get out of this, barely, eh, hardly [scrapes

02:45:29.817 --> 02:45:38.095
throat] maybe 10%, you know, eh, eh, the tactical decision by, by his attorney Busch, eh,  so he doesn't

02:45:38.095 --> 02:45:46.139
stir me at all. But  the eh NebenklÃ¤ger, first of all, they stir me a great deal. Because the majority

02:45:46.139 --> 02:45:54.026
of them, and I have talked to many of them, not all, but many of them, in one way or the other during

02:45:54.026 --> 02:46:01.836
the interactions in the last three days, eh, they think very much like me, they are quite often, not

02:46:01.836 --> 02:46:10.114
always, quite liberal, quite, eh, quite of similar opinions. I don't see any revenge eh, eh, eh, direct,

02:46:10.114 --> 02:46:18.079
eh, revenge feelings, nor do I have revenge feelings. I mean, I'd love it if that, if that stretcher

02:46:18.079 --> 02:46:25.889
on which he lies in the court room would be underground, but do I care? Not really. So that's the,

02:46:25.889 --> 02:46:33.854
that's him. And that's the NebenklÃ¤ger with whom I find very much kinship, very much. Even though

02:46:33.854 --> 02:46:41.898
I've never met any of them. Eh and it's not because, well it is because they're Dutch and because

02:46:41.898 --> 02:46:49.863
they have been through what I've been doing and they, because they're Jews and because eh [scrapes

02:46:49.863 --> 02:46:57.751
throat] so many years this has been with every, with each of us and all of us, that there is a lot of

02:46:57.751 --> 02:47:05.560
eh, of, of common ground and common understanding. Number three in the, in the, in, in this theatre,

02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:13.838
and it is after all, if you look from the outside, a theatre of sorts, and I don't mean this negatively,

02:47:13.838 --> 02:47:22.272
eh  eh, is the court.  Before I go to the court, let's go closer to home, that's the, our eh, attorneys.

02:47:22.272 --> 02:47:26.646
This is a group of the finest, the finest human beings-

02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:26.940
Hmhm

02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:35.075
and there are differences between them. But I knew what I was going into, when about six weeks ago, I

02:47:35.075 --> 02:47:43.130
had an interview with eh attorney professor Nestler, by s, by eh Skype. I was in front of my laptop,

02:47:43.130 --> 02:47:51.588
in my office, in San Diego, and he was at home, in Frankfurt on his desk in his office with his computer.

02:47:51.588 --> 02:47:59.642
And we talked for 90 minutes. And I think, I'm quite sure, that he wanted to know who's this guy

02:47:59.642 --> 02:48:07.858
coming from San Diego all the way? What is he, what is he after? What is he about? I want to know what

02:48:07.858 --> 02:48:16.236
he's about, whom I'm presenting. And I wanted to know, hey, gee, who's going to present me in this

02:48:16.236 --> 02:48:24.532
thing? And it took twenty minutes for us to know each other and 90 minutes for us to be very happy with

02:48:24.532 --> 02:48:32.587
each other. And my, he hadn't told me that and I haven't told him that either. It's completely

02:48:32.587 --> 02:48:40.964
obvious. We understand perfectly. Now, he, with his associate eh lawyers, as the representatives of the,

02:48:40.964 --> 02:48:49.180
of the NebenklÃ¤ger, eh, eh, I cannot imagine a finer group of people to pre, represent us in a German

02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:57.316
court. Number three or four, is the, the court. Eh and there are some others and that's the judges.

02:48:57.316 --> 02:49:05.451
seven people, five judges and two associate-judges or maybe they're in, in their latest stages of,

02:49:05.451 --> 02:49:13.506
of  I'm not sure. Eh, I sat there to testify  and one of the reasons I did not break down in front

02:49:13.506 --> 02:49:21.641
of them was I was close enough to look them all in the eye and they looked me in the eyes. And I have

02:49:21.641 --> 02:49:29.696
complete  trust in what I saw. There is just no doubt in my mind that these people are, just as they

02:49:29.696 --> 02:49:38.718
should, honestly, fairly, going to treat this trial. And that gave me, at that moment, such a, eh, satisfaction,

02:49:38.718 --> 02:49:46.934
mental satisfaction, that I might have wanted, eh, I might have, I might have eh, normally broken down

02:49:46.934 --> 02:49:55.150
in front there, and some people did. I didn't. Because I really put my trust in this, in this court.

02:49:55.150 --> 02:50:03.285
The last, almost last, two, two others. The defense attorney [grins] is p, is also pathetic. It's a

02:50:03.285 --> 02:50:11.340
joke. In 2009 to make the, the, the formal points he's trying to make, and he has to do so, he's

02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:14.160
being paid for that, it's his job

02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:15.230
Absolutely!

02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:24.926
Yeah, but if you look at the, at the arguments, the arguments are, eh, eh, irrelevant. There is no defense

02:50:24.926 --> 02:50:34.347
for Demjanjuk in this court. There is no defense for Demjanjuk in this world, by now, we know more than

02:50:34.347 --> 02:50:44.135
enough to k, to, to, to state that. And it will take, a formal, half year trial to come to that conclusion.

02:50:44.135 --> 02:50:53.374
And most probably that will be the conclusion, not necessarily for sure, but, and that shouldn't be

02:50:53.374 --> 02:51:02.704
for sure, it should be a fair trial. Last is the only point in the proceedings in the last three days,

02:51:02.704 --> 02:51:12.492
in court, where I became eh, eh, stressed, or not stressed, eh, eh, emotionally involved, is by the reading

02:51:12.492 --> 02:51:21.639
of the eh, accusations. By the prosecutor. And not by the facts. Well, yes, also the facts, the way

02:51:21.639 --> 02:51:30.787
he structured the, the accusation against Demjanjuk. The facts he mentioned, the dates he mentioned

02:51:30.787 --> 02:51:40.209
were all very significant. I w, I didn't expect to hear that. Such a complete eh, eh, eh, re,  of the

02:51:40.209 --> 02:51:49.356
facts. But what really got me emotional was who was presenting this. A guy the age of my children. A

02:51:49.356 --> 02:51:58.778
very, very young, obviously highly intelligent young lawyer, German, young lawyer who has no connection

02:51:58.778 --> 02:52:08.748
to all of these historical events  and that hÃ© was presenting this for us, or in this case, I got emotional.

02:52:08.748 --> 02:52:17.987
It was the only thing that really stirred me. Demjanjuk, the, the defense council Busch, ah, to hell

02:52:17.987 --> 02:52:27.409
with them. Nothing. So, eh, it was to me personally, it is to me personally, it's just the beginning,

02:52:27.409 --> 02:52:36.556
highly relevant, both on a personal and a Jewish and a personal historical eh, eh, eh aspect. But in

02:52:36.556 --> 02:52:45.704
addition it is of major consequence, I think, in eh, eh, international or world judicial procedures.

02:52:45.704 --> 02:52:54.942
This is not simple. This emanates directly from the Nuremberg Trials. Now, the Nuremberg Trials tried

02:52:54.942 --> 02:53:04.273
eh, two dozen or three dozen, I forget how many, maybe 200, I'm not really sure, of the biggest fish

02:53:04.273 --> 02:53:13.786
[scrapes throat] in the Nazi Party. And the major, many of them were executed. Certainly the first ones,

02:53:13.786 --> 02:53:23.116
the big, biggest ones. But at Nuremberg, and I've read some serious books about this, they eh coined

02:53:23.116 --> 02:53:32.630
a new world judicial order. There, before Nuremberg, there was no such thing. No such crime, as eh crime

02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:42.326
against humanity. In Nuremberg, an American judge, or an American court, with Russian and a, and a British

02:53:42.326 --> 02:53:51.473
and a, and a French, eh, eh, sat in justice eh, with German eh perpetrators of the, of the Shoah, of

02:53:51.473 --> 02:54:00.895
the, of genocide . And eh, it sat completely new eh, eh standards of world eh, eh of a world judiciary.

02:54:00.895 --> 02:54:10.317
Which of course was later translated into the, eh the court in The International court in The Hague and

02:54:10.317 --> 02:54:19.464
that sort of thing. Eh, it didn't exist before. But this court too is trying a Ukrainian American,

02:54:19.464 --> 02:54:29.618
non-citizen of any, anywhere, stateless, in a German court. These are precedents that are of major consequence.

02:54:29.618 --> 02:54:38.765
And they serve my belief that eh, a, eh independent countries, with independent judiciaries, eh, are

02:54:38.765 --> 02:54:48.004
not a sufficient answer to the problems of our world, of our, of our culture of world. And in that it

02:54:48.004 --> 02:54:57.700
is establishing eh some new eh, eh, some new criteria of eh, eh, how to judge, how to eh, have a criminal,

02:54:57.700 --> 02:55:06.939
eh criminal eh case, and eh, eh what is and what isn't allowed and even for 65 years ago. So I find

02:55:06.939 --> 02:55:16.178
the whole case, the whole thing eh, the case as a, eh, eh, up till now, in many ways very satisfying,

02:55:16.178 --> 02:55:22.672
very right and done completely correctly. I hope I didn't overdo it.-

02:55:22.490 --> 02:55:24.480
No. Thank you. Now
