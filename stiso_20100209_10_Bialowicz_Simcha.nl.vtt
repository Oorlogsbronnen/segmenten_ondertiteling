45:49.890 --> 45:49.890
I'm happy he was not killed.

45:49.890 --> 45:49.890

45:49.890 --> 45:49.890

45:54.060 --> 45:55.820
Yes.

45:56.400 --> 46:01.360
Ok. Um can he remember anything he can tell me about Sobibor?

46:01.360 --> 46:01.920
Do you have anything you

46:01.920 --> 46:01.920
I laid there on the floor,

46:01.920 --> 46:01.920
Mmhmm.

46:01.920 --> 46:07.990
he killed everyone, he came and took out, he wanted to kill

46:07.990 --> 46:13.650
me and then he said, stop, I need him don't kill him.

46:13.650 --> 46:24.500
He was lying there in the transport and then VWagner came and wanted to kill him.

46:27.590 --> 46:33.030
But then he was brought to the labor camp, I assume

46:33.030 --> 46:35.540
And you got to the labor camp from there?

46:35.540 --> 46:35.540
Ah? From there

46:35.540 --> 46:36.340
You were brought to the labor camp from there?

46:36.340 --> 46:36.340
Yes.

46:36.340 --> 46:36.760
Mmhmm.

46:36.760 --> 46:36.920
And there, did he have a special place?

46:36.920 --> 46:42.840
Did you have a special place there?

46:42.840 --> 46:42.840
What?

46:42.840 --> 46:44.650
In the labor camp did you have a

46:45.120 --> 46:45.830
There was a place for the medicine.

46:45.830 --> 46:46.700
Where the medicines were.

46:46.700 --> 46:54.466
Eh, eh, eh, the pharma, it was like the pharmacy, there were all sorts of things that needed to

46:54.466 --> 47:02.070
be organized, everything was written, written out, I was familiar with them, so I would there

47:02.070 --> 47:07.610
I would sort the medicines out because nobody knew the names and I would

47:07.610 --> 47:09.510
Doctors would come, would come, and also pharmacists

47:09.510 --> 47:09.510
Mmhmm.

47:09.510 --> 47:14.180
and the drugs were in the, eh, packages

47:14.180 --> 47:16.230
Mmhmm. Doctors and pharmacists would come

47:16.230 --> 47:17.050
so they wouldn't know what to do with it,

47:17.050 --> 47:19.030
and they wouldn't know what to do with it.

47:19.210 --> 47:25.619
so I would he would have killed me also but he knew that I, I could do , eh, eh, this and

47:25.619 --> 47:32.029
that, and I would prepare packages for him as well, he would tell me to prepare a package

47:32.029 --> 47:39.158
for him you already know, he said, this, this and that. He gave me a list and I prepared everything

47:39.158 --> 47:44.560
for him and he took it when he went home, on a leave, took it with him yes.

47:44.560 --> 47:58.968
He would give me a list of medicines to put in a package and I would do it and I would

47:58.968 --> 48:13.210
put it in a package and he would take it when he went to vacation or out of the camp.

48:13.210 --> 48:19.393
My brother my brother saw that they took me to work there that they looked for a pharmacist,

48:19.393 --> 48:25.241
so he sneaked over, I told you already to the, to the group, he was a little boy, eh he

48:25.241 --> 48:31.358
turned towards my group, he already knew that they took me, me to work, so he stayed alive.

48:31.358 --> 48:35.660
So afterwards I had to protect him all the time till the escape.

48:35.660 --> 48:35.660
His microphone.

48:35.660 --> 48:36.460
Oh, excuse me.

48:41.870 --> 48:44.100
Oh that.

48:44.100 --> 48:44.100
The microphone.

48:44.100 --> 48:44.100
Yes, yes.

48:44.100 --> 48:49.146
Um, his brother was a little boy and, um, when he saw he had, they gave him work

48:49.146 --> 48:54.318
to do there as a pharmacist, so his brother went from his group, they were divided

48:54.318 --> 48:59.238
into groups and his brother went from his group to his group and he sneaked up

48:59.238 --> 49:02.960
behind him and he had to watch him all the time afterwards.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.748
He gave me a li, list, eh with all sorts of things, so I prepared

49:04.748 --> 49:06.290
it for him, when he went on a leave he took it with him.

49:06.290 --> 49:20.450
He gave him a list of drugs to, to pack for him and he would take it.

49:20.450 --> 49:23.110

49:46.821 --> 49:48.950

49:48.950 --> 49:52.040
It was like a basement with, with medicine, it wasn't really a pharmacy.

49:52.040 --> 49:57.400
That's right, I sorted out everything, all the medicine that was there,

49:57.400 --> 50:01.780
and organized this, this and that, it wasn't a pharmacy,

50:01.780 --> 50:06.061
Yeah, it wasn't like a pharmacy pharmacy, it was just a basement

50:06.061 --> 50:09.760
with a lot of drugs and medicine and he would sort it out

50:09.760 --> 50:09.980
It was a warehouse, a warehouse for medicine

So eh, so he said thatit's impossible for such a thing to have happened here.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:59.897
He, eh made two poison bottles, eh, one for the Ukrainians and, kitchen, because there were two

01:00:59.897 --> 01:01:08.014
kitchens, one for the Germans and one for the Ukrainians and, um, the night before this was, he

01:01:08.014 --> 01:01:16.730

01:01:50.482 --> 01:01:54.839
him and said that these things don't happen here.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:06.314
They thought that it could be, eh they didn't know that

01:02:06.314 --> 01:02:16.380
I prepared it, eh, I prepared a bottle, I opened ,

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:16.570

the Ukrainians and one for the S.S, for the, for the Germans,

01:02:51.470 --> 01:03:06.590
He did it one for the Ukrainians and one for the Germans?

01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:19.666
so eh .the woman from the, from the kitchen, she had a Ukrainian acquaintance that was

guarding the place, and one night, a Ukrainian escaped, they worked there so he ran away

01:03:33.046 --> 01:03:45.970
from there, so eh they came to the place and wanted to know what, what happened, they

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:59.198
came, so she told, she told, she told me that she got, they came to me with the poison,

01:03:59.198 --> 01:04:13.643

01:04:13.643 --> 01:04:23.070
everything is sealed, everything is sealed, its not from here.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:25.570
They, they came to him

01:04:29.464 --> 01:04:32.600
didn't happen from here and they showed him that all the bottles are

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.460
Closed

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.360
closed and haven't been opened and he protected him from this.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.590
So nothing happened?

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.900
It was the poison that I made!

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.960
Yes, and it was the poison that I made because Vagner and the woman came with the poison

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.023
So he said these things don't happen here, everything

01:04:44.023 --> 01:04:44.990
is sealed, is sealed, all of the drugs are sealed,

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.960
So nothing happened at all?

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.070
And in the end nothing happened?

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:50.422

person, , nothing happened, I couldn't, we couldn't do anything.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:19.310
Nothing bad happened

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:24.970

and killed them and burned them, so eh, so eh Vagner was, they wanted to take me as well,

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.900
Mmhmm.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:20.482
he said, eh, I need, I need him, he needed me, there was such chaos there, the majority were

01:07:20.482 --> 01:07:30.950
doctors and and, and, and pharmacists, pharmacist, in the, in the pharmacy, drugs, a lot of

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:41.532
drugs, I worked at the pharmacy, so I was familiar with them, that's all, so eh, I , there

01:07:41.532 --> 01:07:52.230
was a mess, so he came, so he said he killed everybody there, all the people that were in the

01:07:52.230 --> 01:08:02.812
transport , so I was, eh, there in the middle so he said: what about him so he wanted, so he

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:13.165
told him: not him, I need, eh ..? he needed me, if not for me he wouldn't have been able

01:08:13.165 --> 01:08:23.633
to do , he wasn't, eh, wasn't a pharmacist, he didn't have the knowledge, and I had the

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:31.570
knowledge, so that's why they didn't, didn't, didn't kill me.

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.290
Well tell him, uh, it may be good for the tape, his wife says it's not Demjanjuk, it's Miller?

01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:42.593
Eh, your wife tells us that it wasn't Demjanjuk, it was Miller,

01:08:42.593 --> 01:08:49.750
that, that took you to work at the pharmacy at the

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:49.750
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:49.750
But it doesn't matter.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.820
Um, I wanted him to talk as much as he can about how he got out of the camp, during the uprising.

01:08:52.820 --> 01:09:03.120
Eh, can you speak about, em how you got out of the camp, out of the camp, during the uprise?

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:03.120

How you got out? Please tell us.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:13.729
So, we escaped, yes, and we talked about the escape that everyone knew about it.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:22.848
And one time in the evening we said that and we escaped, we killed them, we already

01:09:22.848 --> 01:09:31.638
had weapons, so we killed the, the, the guards, yes we escaped, so from there, I

01:09:31.638 --> 01:09:39.000
I knew, so I left everything and I ran with them together, together

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:57.710
Everybody knew that it was going to happen and they had arms already and they killed the guards and

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:04.917
We went, we invited them to come to the office there, so that, eh, the tailor,

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:08.420
A jacket?

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.644
so he, so he came for measurements there, he was invited, so, at the side of the room there was a niche,

01:10:10.644 --> 01:10:12.783

01:10:25.111 --> 01:10:29.659
from a hiding place and they killed them and then they took the guard's arms, um

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:29.870
Yes

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:30.660

01:10:51.426 --> 01:11:02.743
in the camp and then he saw us and we escaped and there weren't a lot of S.S soldiers, they weren't

01:11:02.743 --> 01:11:13.290
there, we did it when they were outside, and in the, in the entrance, so they opened fire, so we

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:23.838
already had weapons, the ones we took, and we escaped in the water, that was the way to pass, so

01:11:23.838 --> 01:11:31.530
we passed through, around it was water, but not deep, we escaped there

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:40.303
We escaped with the guns, we, uh, had to es, we had to go through, uh, like rivers

01:11:40.303 --> 01:11:49.076
and there was a lot of water around the camp, and but it wasn't very deep and we

01:11:49.076 --> 01:11:57.636
also did this, there weren't a lot of S.S in the camps when we when we escaped

01:11:57.636 --> 01:12:05.340

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.830
Ok, and where did he come to?

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:15.690

Did he see the Russians coming? When did he hear, how did he hear that the Russians were coming?

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:24.970
How did you hear the Russians were coming?

01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:30.230
No, we were there, at night we used to go outside for a bit, at night,

01:20:31.283 --> 01:20:31.760
village, each person had a Pole they knew in a village, so he,

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.010
Mmhmm.

01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:35.610

01:20:42.943 --> 01:20:44.570
your free now there are no, there are no Germans anymore.

01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:57.510
When the Russians came, then the Polish person told him to get out

01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:03.439
We got, got out, where to go?, each person went to the direction which he

came to them, they took everything from them and then killed them.

01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:14.730
Ok.

01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:14.822
We were scared because these Polish people also killed people

01:21:14.822 --> 01:21:14.900
that came to hide in their house, but we paid them.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.230

After the Russians conquered Poland, did you stay in Poland?

01:21:19.190 --> 01:21:25.879
We stayed in Poland, first of all, eh, we searched for a place, our city was small, we ran,

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:33.191

01:22:33.191 --> 01:22:46.410

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:54.576
