00:09.970 --> 00:16.350
This is an interview with Esther Raab and it's made in New Jersey. Hello Esther.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.470
Hi.

00:17.650 --> 00:25.360
Which year were you born and where?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.290
In which year?

00:27.290 --> 00:27.590
Yes.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.040
In 1922.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.480
In Chelm?

00:30.480 --> 00:31.450
In Chelm.

00:31.450 --> 00:31.830
In Poland?

00:31.830 --> 00:33.400
Yes.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.970
So, can you talk about your family? Do you want me to ask questions?

00:37.970 --> 00:40.540
Whatever is convenient for you.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.030
It is most convenient that you talk about your family house.

00:43.230 --> 00:54.990
I had a very nice family. We were two children, which for Europe was unusual. [laughs]

00:54.990 --> 00:55.820
Yes, it was.

00:55.820 --> 01:06.020
And my father was, I would say, comfortable.

01:11.120 --> 01:17.010
He was a businessman, my father, and we had a good life.

01:17.200 --> 01:28.240
And I have here pictures from our house. We were very comfortable.

01:28.240 --> 01:36.100
I would love to make a photo of those pictures later, if you agree?

01:36.100 --> 01:37.160
Yes.

01:37.350 --> 01:39.910
Later, not now.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.110
Yes, sure.

01:42.110 --> 01:44.190
Okay. Did you have a brother or sister?

01:44.190 --> 01:48.030
A brother.[points finger] I still have a brother.

01:48.180 --> 01:48.850
Good for you.

01:48.850 --> 01:50.940
He was born in 1917.

01:50.940 --> 01:55.160
And he's still there.

01:55.400 --> 01:55.650
Yes.

01:55.650 --> 01:58.730
Did he also go through Sobibor?

01:58.730 --> 02:09.143
No. When they took him to Sobibor, and they shot my father on the march

02:09.143 --> 02:18.090
to Sobibor, he like landed on top of him and came home alive.

02:39.780 --> 02:39.980
That is a miracle. It was a miracle. Absolutely.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.780
So let's go back to your family house.

02:41.780 --> 02:42.570
Yes.

02:42.570 --> 02:43.050
It is a shocking story.

02:43.050 --> 02:59.580
Yes. I have the family house picture, everything. Later this would go to the gentile

02:59.580 --> 03:13.750
who saved me my brother and would have given his life to save my father.

03:13.750 --> 03:17.410
That is after you got out of Sobibor? After the escape?

03:17.410 --> 03:26.923
No, right there. My brother didn't go to Sobibor. He escaped from Staw-Nowosiulki, that was

03:26.923 --> 03:36.948
a small Arbeiterlager. And he escaped right away. He went to a gentile who was a very good friend,

03:36.948 --> 03:45.030
he was with my father like this. He went there and he took him in and kept him.

04:11.600 --> 04:11.810
Unbelievable.

04:14.710 --> 04:15.320
Yes.

04:15.320 --> 04:22.570
But let us go to you. You were eighteen already when the war broke out.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.210
How old?

04:24.210 --> 04:24.370
Eighteen?

04:24.370 --> 04:27.660
Younger, you know. Seventeen.

04:27.980 --> 04:28.170
Seventeen.

04:28.170 --> 04:28.780
Yes.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.860
Did you go to school?

04:30.860 --> 04:44.320
Yes. I finished public school and then I went to a Catholic school.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.110
Catholic?!

04:45.110 --> 04:51.116
Yes, my mother felt that I got a better education in

04:51.116 --> 04:56.660
a Catholic school and they were very nice to me.

04:59.110 --> 05:03.100
So, was your family still religious?

05:03.100 --> 05:03.200
What?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.930
Was your family religious?

05:06.870 --> 05:07.750
Very religious.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.810
Very religious, but still...

05:09.810 --> 05:11.010
Yes, my mother always wore... A sheitel.

05:11.010 --> 05:23.694
A sheitel. Yes, very religious. But my mother liked the crowd in

05:23.694 --> 05:36.180
the Catholic school better than the crowd in the public school.

05:36.650 --> 05:40.160
Because they were better educated?

05:40.420 --> 05:58.320
They thought you would get different manners and you were with nice kids, that's why they did it.

05:58.910 --> 05:59.927
Sure. I understand. But before you went to the Catholic school,

05:59.927 --> 06:00.880
had you been seeing a lot of Catholic girls, or was it new?

06:17.540 --> 06:18.320
Friends in the street.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.840
Everybody was friends.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.990
Yes, in the street! And my mother felt that I got Hebrew education in the

06:24.990 --> 06:29.254
afternoon everyday. And she felt that the company that I got there was much

06:29.254 --> 06:32.950
better for me. First of all, only girls. That's what she felt .

06:51.320 --> 06:58.470
And at home she kept a very strict Jewish household?

06:58.470 --> 07:07.330
Yes. I told you, my father wore a...

07:07.330 --> 07:07.690
Beard.

07:07.690 --> 07:17.206
...beard and my mother a sheitel and she came from a very Jewish, religious

07:17.206 --> 07:26.470
family. But she figured, she has one daughter, why not give her the best?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.030
Sure. I understand.

07:31.440 --> 07:39.904
You know, people had houses full with maybe five or six children

07:39.904 --> 07:47.840
who had to wear a uniform in this school. She felt it was...

07:47.840 --> 07:49.210
Better.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.170
...better.

07:50.170 --> 07:50.500
Sure.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.980
Because I had a Jewish education.

07:53.610 --> 08:00.680
Were you prepared as a girl for your future to have a Jewish household?

08:00.730 --> 08:01.640
Yes.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.150
Can you tell about it?

08:03.150 --> 08:03.970
Yes.

08:03.970 --> 08:04.900
What did they teach you?

08:04.900 --> 08:09.100
To eat kosher.

08:09.370 --> 08:11.610
Which is complicated. [laughs]

08:13.220 --> 08:22.112
Yes. And to have nice friends, it didn't matter they were Jewish or not. I don't

08:22.112 --> 08:30.899
think my mother made a big deal. If I brought non-Jewish friends, they would eat at

08:30.899 --> 08:40.003
our table, because mostly they were poor, you know? And we had plenty to eat [laughs],

08:40.003 --> 08:49.637
which was a problem. We lived very comfortably in Chelm. My father had a mill with partners

08:49.637 --> 08:56.729
and he was a comfortable man. He had a lot of non-Jewish customers.

09:19.820 --> 09:30.730
And did you have close family living near?

09:30.730 --> 09:32.840
Yes. In the same city.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.340
Chelm was a pretty big city at that time?

09:35.340 --> 09:55.979
Yes, I think it had maybe more than ten thousand Jews. They had a Hebrew high school,

09:55.979 --> 10:14.920
a Besiako which was a Jewish-paid school, so I went there after public school.

10:15.610 --> 10:30.724
I used to go there for two hours so as to learn Hebrew, and my mother had the dream that

10:30.724 --> 10:44.980
maybe I would go to Krakow, to Besiako, and there maybe find a husband or whatever.

10:47.220 --> 10:55.390
Were you talking about what was happening to Jews in Germany? Were you aware of that?

10:55.390 --> 11:16.860
We didn't know that much, no. We felt that Hitler wasn't so popular in my young life.

11:21.150 --> 11:28.780
So, when did you feel the danger started coming? It was first the Russians who came, of course.

11:29.780 --> 11:33.426
Yes. My father had one customer, a gentile. He was one of his biggest customers, whom he had

11:33.426 --> 11:37.191
helped a lot, he had escaped from Russia. My father met him on the street and he said, what are

11:37.191 --> 11:40.877
you doing here, you live in an attic, how do you make a living? Do you have acquaintances? He

11:40.877 --> 11:44.523
said, if someone lent me half a sack of flour, I could bake bread in the basement and make a

11:44.523 --> 11:48.209
living. My father said, I'll give you half a sack of flour, don't worry. And to make this

11:48.209 --> 11:51.380
story short, that man became the richest in our city and never forgot my father.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.590
He became a righteous?

12:57.610 --> 13:02.580
What did he become?

13:02.580 --> 13:02.860
A baker.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.110
Okay.

13:03.110 --> 13:19.908
He opened three stores and had a lot of people working for him and never disappointed my father with

13:19.908 --> 13:36.539
any behaviour. He considered my father a most honest and trustworthy man, they became real friends,

13:36.539 --> 13:51.490
and the main thing, they respected each other. Those are the people that saved our lives.

13:51.490 --> 13:55.140
When did you feel the danger for the first time coming?

13:59.710 --> 14:12.657
I didn't, because we lived in a German neighbourhood and I had friends, rich German girls,

14:12.657 --> 14:25.887
who went to school with me. We still did our homework together when a brother (of one of them)

14:25.887 --> 14:37.850
already put on a uniform, but when he walked by our window... "niks Jude, niks Jude".

14:37.850 --> 14:39.210
But it started. At one stage it started, when did it start?

14:48.030 --> 14:49.110
What do you mean?

14:49.110 --> 14:51.920
I mean, at one stage the Germans came.

14:53.230 --> 15:05.621
Oh, it came and my mother remembered the First World War and she said, you sit at home, and you

15:05.621 --> 15:17.360
do your own thing and you go on with your business, and the Germans are the nicest people.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.000
But they came.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.240
When they came, the first day we knew right away.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.030
Why?

15:26.030 --> 15:36.605
I'll show you where we lived, across the street were all Germans, Catholics who worked in the industry.

15:36.605 --> 15:46.374
They had a lot of industry in the town and the girls all were my friends. My brother and that one

15:46.374 --> 15:56.647
brother were also friends. They had a beautiful home, I don't know how many rooms, about ten, twelve

15:56.647 --> 16:06.719
rooms. But we could come in there and they treated us well. There was also one house occupied by one

16:06.719 --> 16:16.689
family, a big house. We had a big mental institution in Chelm, the biggest in Europe. And they used

16:16.689 --> 16:23.739
to take care of the mentally ill, so they gave my father the business.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.400
It was a good life?

17:04.400 --> 17:05.140
Yes.

17:08.690 --> 17:11.160
So how did it change?

17:13.470 --> 17:23.180
When they came in and my mother said, everybody is going to sit down and let's

17:23.180 --> 17:33.256
not go out, because we read the papers already. But we couldn't believe that they

17:33.256 --> 17:42.360
could be such a mean people, that they had something against honest people.

17:42.360 --> 17:47.660
So that was a shock?

17:47.660 --> 17:57.135
A big shock. And most of the Jews from Chelm, like the working class or the poor people

17:57.135 --> 18:06.392
went away, because before we had had the Russians and they encouraged them to go away

18:06.392 --> 18:13.689
to Russia and to communism. But my father was far from a communist.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.240
Be careful with your hand and the microphone please.

18:25.240 --> 18:25.740
What?

18:25.740 --> 18:30.530
Okay, it's fine. You have your hand on the microphone.

18:30.530 --> 18:31.320
Like this?

18:31.320 --> 18:35.530
Yes, like that, you can't hear. That's not good.

18:35.530 --> 18:36.570
No?

18:37.490 --> 18:38.690
This way it's better. Now it's fantastic. So, the poor people went with the Russians?

18:45.620 --> 18:59.096
Yes, because of the work. Poland wasn't anti-Semitic, but my father was in the business with

18:59.096 --> 19:13.577
all those Polacks and he didn't have any grudge against them or hard feelings. He did his business,

19:13.577 --> 19:24.760
he paid his bills and they paid their bills. And we lived one next to another.

19:24.760 --> 19:28.470
So he never even discussed to go East with the Russians?

19:29.180 --> 19:29.740
No.

19:29.740 --> 19:34.710
And then the Germans came. When did you see them for the first time?

19:47.460 --> 19:50.929
They were probably prepared for a bad time, but not that bad. My father used to go every

19:50.929 --> 19:54.360
day to the Polacks. We had a lot of stores that he supplied, so we never felt anything.

20:10.400 --> 20:24.610
And then, can you tell me how it changed, what changed and how?

20:24.610 --> 20:30.637
First of all they organized all the Jews for Friday morning in the middle of the town.

20:30.637 --> 20:36.665
Then they started marching them. Towards another city. We didn't know what they were

20:36.665 --> 20:42.903
doing and why. On that march they killed my father. My brother fell on top of him and got

20:42.903 --> 20:48.370
wounded. We saw it was not a joke. People weren't just talking, they meant it.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.140
He came back to the house, your brother?

21:35.450 --> 21:36.670
Yes!

21:36.910 --> 21:37.470
Wounded?

21:37.470 --> 21:53.124
No, he went to a gentile farmer who took care of my brother's wound. Then he let us know where he

21:53.124 --> 22:07.830
had landed. Near the Russian border. My mother went and got him. My mother was a young woman.

22:07.830 --> 22:07.970
Sure, and then?

22:13.640 --> 22:21.736
So we had lost my father. All those gentiles who had dealt with my father

22:21.736 --> 22:30.387
continued, but in a careful way. But this gentile who saved our lives didn't

22:30.387 --> 22:36.710
give up, because he knew what my father had done for him.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.130
So what did he do?

23:03.130 --> 23:07.940
He used to buy and give my father the profit. And then he said a couple of times, he used to

23:07.940 --> 23:12.802
call him a Brumtje. My father's name was Abraham. He said, I think they took away a Brumtje

23:12.802 --> 23:17.717
and that couldn't succeed. But the friendship had been for so many years, he would have done

23:17.717 --> 23:22.579
whatever he could. If the Germans wouldn't kill my father, he would still be a rich man. He

23:22.579 --> 23:27.598
had become a rich man. He had a house full of children, many children, and he never carried that

23:27.598 --> 23:31.520
grudge, that German grudge. He felt that nothing good would come out of it.

24:40.250 --> 24:45.809
Can you tell me the story how he saved you and your mother, can

24:45.809 --> 24:50.840
you tell me the story of how he saved your life? [louder]

24:55.220 --> 25:05.290
Yes. He helped us. How, an awful lot.

25:05.410 --> 25:06.230
Tell me.

25:06.230 --> 25:23.729
When the Nazis started taking over, he sent bread and flour during summer. He had bought a farm,

25:23.729 --> 25:40.865
he sent us bed stables. So we didn't feel things. We felt if we have a problem, we can go to

25:40.865 --> 25:58.547
him. But then they put us in a ghetto. You know? That wasn't good. But he always helped us. And

25:58.547 --> 26:13.860
you know, if a man helps you with a loaf of bread, even we were only two children...

26:43.150 --> 26:46.130
So you were put in the ghetto of Chelm?

26:46.130 --> 26:47.170
Yes.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.040
How did that go, how did that happen?

26:50.040 --> 26:59.400
I want to show you we had a beautiful private house.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.180
Yes, you'll show me later, yes.

27:00.180 --> 27:17.271
We lived in a very fancy neighbourhood when they decided to make a ghetto. So they put us

27:17.271 --> 27:34.555
with another family, two children, us, and my mother, my father wasn't alive, all in one

27:34.555 --> 27:51.839
room with the kids. And my mother couldn't sleep because they had small children and the

27:51.839 --> 28:10.467
poor things were hungry and they cried the whole time. So we moved, we had family in Siedliszcze,

28:10.467 --> 28:22.950
not far from us, and they said we should come and stay with them.

28:23.450 --> 28:23.790
In Liske? Siedliszcze. Siedliszcze, yes?

28:23.790 --> 28:36.345
And we moved there. My mother said one of our uncles had a bakery, she could work in the

28:36.345 --> 28:49.613
bakery and I could help with the children. It would maybe be easier than being in that house,

28:49.613 --> 29:01.169
but you know, I think the neighbours didn't like it that we moved. Had to move.

29:01.340 --> 29:01.750
Why?

29:01.750 --> 29:03.115
They were so accustomed to us. Across the street lived a German family. The girl went to school with

29:03.115 --> 29:04.454
me. To high school. I went to business school. And they just didn't like it. I don't think our

29:04.454 --> 29:05.806
neighbours would say no when asked, do you want the Terners, our name was Terner, to live here? You

29:05.806 --> 29:07.186
know, I used to knit for them, I don't know how to say, they didn't abuse us. They just said good

29:07.186 --> 29:08.320
morning to you and maybe deep down they had some thoughts, but we didn't feel it.

30:24.530 --> 30:31.550
Who told your mother that your father had been killed? [louder]

30:36.220 --> 30:37.290
My brother came back.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.340
And how was your mother?

30:41.340 --> 30:55.642
My mother's whole world was gone. She had lost her husband and she felt they had had

30:55.642 --> 31:10.796
a very good life, you know, together. We weren't poor, we lived in a comfortable house,

31:10.796 --> 31:25.099
my brother had a room, I had a room. In Europe they didn't have it like this. In a

31:25.099 --> 31:37.869
beautiful neighbourhood. All the people had houses, not just rooms, houses!

31:37.870 --> 31:38.790
So you moved to Siedliszcze?

31:38.790 --> 31:52.504
Yes. And there we started going to work. My father wasn't alive anymore. My mother

31:52.504 --> 32:06.545
was very upset and we had to protect her from going to work, because she wasn't able

32:06.545 --> 32:20.423
to work, like walking miles a day. I'm making it short, my mother wanted to make it

32:20.423 --> 32:33.974
easier and less responsible for us, because we used to take her away into the woods

32:33.974 --> 32:45.730
so they wouldn't take her to work. Because she couldn't have lasted.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.130
There was forced labour in Siedliszcze?

32:49.130 --> 32:53.067
Right away. Yes. Not in our city. But all over the countryside. Right away. My mother didn't

32:53.067 --> 32:56.795
want to be a burden to the two of us. So she went to the police and asked to be shot. And

32:56.795 --> 33:00.230
they did her the favour. She felt that the two of us, or maybe one, would survive.

33:22.970 --> 33:28.520
So she went to the Germans?

33:32.570 --> 33:42.680
Yes! The Polish and German police were still the same. And they shot her.

33:42.680 --> 33:46.060
And what did they do with her?

33:46.060 --> 33:49.953
We buried her there. Because we went to work and they got her, I mean, they didn't

33:49.953 --> 33:53.523
get her, she went in. They threw her at the end of the woods and when we came

33:53.523 --> 33:56.490
they'd buried her there. Not that we found remains of her. No.

34:12.140 --> 34:17.240
You didn't? But you gave her a service?

34:19.890 --> 34:20.520
Yes.

34:20.520 --> 34:20.780
As if she were buried? Yes.

34:20.780 --> 34:20.780
That's beautiful.

34:20.780 --> 34:21.140
[sighs] What could you do?

34:21.140 --> 34:22.180
No, it's beautiful. It's beautiful if you don't have the body, still to make the service.

34:42.080 --> 34:50.210
Yes. I mean, they didn't burn her or anything like what we saw later, you know, in Sobibor.

34:50.210 --> 34:57.410
And so you were alone with your brother then?

34:57.410 --> 35:04.878
I was alone with my brother. They moved us to a section

35:04.878 --> 35:11.260
and we got like a room and a kitchen. You know.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.000
Still in Siedliszcze?

35:14.530 --> 35:27.757
Yes. We could go to work but we didn't. We missed our mother. You know, at that time I

35:27.757 --> 35:41.435
think we felt that everybody is gonna go, sooner or later. And we just figured that, maybe,

35:41.435 --> 35:53.460
my mother was better off. That she was a smart woman and went to ask to be shot.

35:53.460 --> 36:01.070
What kind of work did you do then?

36:01.260 --> 36:27.300
I would mostly pull weeds and clean woods and all that.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.970
Hard manual labour.

36:28.970 --> 36:29.950
Yes.

36:29.950 --> 36:30.960
But you managed.

36:33.530 --> 36:44.665
Yes. We had still some valuables my mother gave to us. You know? And

36:44.665 --> 36:55.310
from the farmers we could buy bread or a little meat or whatever.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.740
You had enough to eat?

36:58.840 --> 37:02.990
In the beginning, yes. Not in Sobibor. [laughs]

37:02.990 --> 37:05.790
No, of course not [laughs]. How long did that last? I guess this is '42, or '41? Is this 1942?

37:17.470 --> 37:18.774
It was already '41. Then they made the ghetto and they didn't know what to do, those Germans.

37:18.774 --> 37:20.120
I mean, they were miserable. They took us, they took young people away and they used them for manual

37:20.120 --> 37:21.452
labour. You know? They had a lot to build, they had a lot to construct, they came to Poland. Poland

37:21.452 --> 37:22.743
wasn't a poor country. Plenty to eat. Plenty mills and plenty meat. They were poor in Germany.

37:22.743 --> 37:23.820
Then they started chasing us from one ghetto to another ghetto, to other cities.

38:41.190 --> 38:45.790
You were chased from one ghetto to another. Where did you go, can you remember?

38:47.300 --> 38:55.418
Sure! I was in Siedliszcze, then they made a camp near Siedliszcze and we used to go to work from

38:55.418 --> 39:03.621
there. They really didn't make such a big use of our labour. It was like a game for them. It was

39:03.621 --> 39:11.740
a game. Meanwhile they checked you, things you were carrying with you, and they would find a nice

39:11.740 --> 39:19.190
watch, a nice dress, a pair of shoes, and take it off, you know? Whatever they could use.

39:44.440 --> 39:48.780
So, after Siedliszcze you went where?

39:52.150 --> 39:54.740
Siedliszcze they made like Judenrein, you know? Yes.

39:54.740 --> 40:13.128
They took us to Staw-Nowosiulki camp. But nothing special. Just going to work. They

40:13.128 --> 40:30.630
weren't really using those people's talents, just moving them here and there. They just moved you around.

40:36.810 --> 40:47.222
Yes. So I came there. Then we found out that they built camps were going

40:47.222 --> 40:57.346
to destroy young people. They'ld keep them as long as they could and

40:57.346 --> 41:05.590
then... I think they wanted to keep themselves busy, too.

41:09.850 --> 41:11.800
What do you mean with keeping themselves busy?

41:13.680 --> 41:23.480
Not to go to the Front. They were very afraid of the Russians.

41:23.480 --> 41:23.980
Yes, they were.

41:23.980 --> 41:32.342
And they figured, as long as they can manipulate here, they won't

41:32.342 --> 41:40.080
[microphone is moved] Then the SS came. The SS were miserable.

41:40.080 --> 41:47.600
Worse than the Wehrmacht? Till then it was the Wehrmacht?

41:47.600 --> 41:51.772
For a while, here. And I don't think that the Wehrmacht

41:51.772 --> 41:55.140
was so bad. They decided to kill all the Jews.

42:02.990 --> 42:06.600
So what happened when the SS came? What was the difference?

42:08.840 --> 42:28.480
The SS were schooled (educated) and they sent people to the camps. They opened up the camps, the SS.

42:28.480 --> 42:36.870
And you knew that those camps were being opened? You knew about those camps before you were there?

42:41.490 --> 42:44.650
Oh, sure, you didn't have no choice, you had to go.

42:44.650 --> 42:49.770
But you knew that those camps existed.

42:49.770 --> 42:53.670
The death camps.

42:53.670 --> 42:57.350
Yes. So what happened to you?

42:57.350 --> 43:16.189
They took me from Siedliszcze and I went to a camp. They picked me out to work. They asked, who knows

43:16.189 --> 43:35.776
how to sow, whatever they asked I knew. I knew, but I figured, if you have a trade you maybe can survive.

43:35.776 --> 43:54.429
Me and my brother were in a smaller camp like cleaning wooded areas. In the middle of the night they

43:54.429 --> 44:13.082
rounded us up and we knew we were going to a death camp. But we never believed they were taking live

44:13.082 --> 44:31.922
people, useful people. We first came in a smaller camp and then they took us to - where did they take

44:31.922 --> 44:50.203
us? To a new camp, where there were Jews. We used to go to work every day. I don't know why they

44:50.203 --> 45:08.483
needed that work. We were there about two months and then they started to send us to Sobibor. They

45:08.483 --> 45:26.577
took out eight girls and we thought the rest were destroyed. We felt, as long as our clothes last

45:26.577 --> 45:45.790
and we can sell our belongings, we gonna survive. We thought, maybe the Americans will come and survive

45:45.790 --> 45:56.049
(rescue) us, you know? There they took out eight girls.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.130
In order to take care of the Germans?

45:59.280 --> 45:59.690
Yes.

45:59.690 --> 46:01.730
And that was your job?

46:03.450 --> 46:06.710
No, I didn't take care, they didn't.

46:06.710 --> 46:08.600
What did you do?

46:08.600 --> 46:10.356
I started sorting luggage, clothes which were brought. Then we realized that all those people

46:10.356 --> 46:12.037
were getting killed. We saw there was no way that the Germans would lose the war so fast,

46:12.037 --> 46:13.699
that we should survive. The young used to bring like the leftovers from the little towns

46:13.699 --> 46:15.455
and cities into the death camps. We heard that they had opened up Auschwitz, but you didn't

46:15.455 --> 46:16.740
have no choice. There was no choice. Just to go by the day and pray.

47:23.000 --> 47:23.790
You still prayed?

47:23.790 --> 47:24.650
Yes!

47:28.190 --> 47:28.760
A lot?

47:28.760 --> 47:43.299
You see, I have a ring here, from Sobibor. From an older man, an artist in woodwork. Unbelievable.

47:43.299 --> 47:57.542
I asked him and he told me, he knew that I wouldn't eat bread at Pesach, you know? So he said,

47:57.542 --> 48:11.785
could you organize a few potatoes. And I said, I will try, but you know, to steal five potatoes,

48:11.785 --> 48:26.027
you have to give your hat. So I said, I will try. And I organized eight potatoes. And he gave me

48:26.027 --> 48:37.600
that ring. He said, that ring will save your life. And I'm still wearing it.

48:42.940 --> 48:43.260
Wonderful. So you were allowed to have a ring in Sobibor? No.

48:47.010 --> 48:50.310
But how did you do that, then?

48:50.310 --> 48:52.310
I just rolled it in my... Bra.

48:52.310 --> 48:58.940
Yes, and I carried it.

48:58.940 --> 48:59.230
Of course.

48:59.230 --> 49:16.532
You know, you either became religious, or not religious at all. But it's easier to believe that some

49:16.532 --> 49:33.496
miracles gonna happen, or maybe the Germans will drop dead. Even now, you don't wanna be dead, but

49:33.496 --> 49:50.969
then you have to give up. I came to Sobibor before Pesach, and there came a cousin of mine to a rabbi's

49:50.969 --> 50:08.102
son. From Izbica. And he said, we are not gonna remain here. We have to kill them all before. I said,

50:08.102 --> 50:26.423
what a big talk, a rabbi's son gives you a sermon, you know, but they used that time, changed our inmates,

50:26.423 --> 50:43.726
you know. If a transport came in, they picked out new people every time. They told us that the war was

50:43.726 --> 51:01.029
coming to an end, one day you had to lose. You're gonna go into the frying pan anyway, so let's try.

51:01.029 --> 51:18.162
Then, a few weeks later, they started bringing Russian soldiers whom they'd caught. They were killing

51:18.162 --> 51:35.296
us, too. And the young men figured out, maybe the war isn't so good for them, you know, and let's

51:35.296 --> 51:52.599
organize. We started to think, the war didn't go because they didn't send out so much clothes from

51:52.599 --> 52:09.562
the people. They didn't, because they were afraid that on the way they're gonna get caught. With

52:09.562 --> 52:20.249
us inside it wasn't so strict, they got used to us, you know.

52:21.000 --> 52:21.090
yes?

52:21.090 --> 52:21.750
Huh?

52:21.980 --> 52:22.310
Ja?

52:22.310 --> 52:42.720
They figured, we had them in our hands so that they cannot do nothing to us. And we did.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.680
So it was really changing?

52:45.660 --> 53:01.098
Yes. I don't know if the Germans wanted the change. But they were so organized

53:01.098 --> 53:15.958
with the SS and the SA. I guess everybody did what he wanted to do. Then they

53:15.958 --> 53:30.625
brought a lot of women from Russia.They just let them live and they didn't

53:30.625 --> 53:43.170
go to work, maybe they used them for different reasons, you know?

53:43.170 --> 53:45.410
They imported a group of Russian women into Sobibor?

53:46.750 --> 53:53.010
They built a barracks for them and their convenience.

53:54.380 --> 53:56.340
Were those women Jewish?

53:56.340 --> 54:05.570
No. Russian women. They wouldn't dare.

54:05.570 --> 54:07.820
So there was a kind of a brothel in Sobibor?

54:11.110 --> 54:12.890
Yes.

54:15.790 --> 54:17.390
Gosh, nobody told me.

54:17.920 --> 54:27.500
Oh yes. They put up two, they wouldn't take a Jewish woman.

54:27.500 --> 54:28.240
It would be Rassenschande.

54:31.050 --> 54:43.820
That's right. And they called me, he was there, they found my name. Demjanjuk?

54:43.820 --> 54:51.260
Demjanjuk. He was in that brothel?

54:52.490 --> 55:05.732
He wasn't in that brothel. But during the days they worked in a Russian camp between

55:05.732 --> 55:17.590
Sobibor and Piaski. They used to bring those men by train here. I remember...

55:17.590 --> 55:18.320
Well, explain to me.

55:18.320 --> 55:18.650
Demjanjuk.

55:18.650 --> 55:19.382
Better, please. I don't understand the full story. There

55:19.382 --> 55:20.090
was another camp with Russians, and where was Demjanjuk?

55:29.300 --> 55:30.390
What did you say?

55:36.590 --> 55:40.880
There were those Russian women, and you say, Demjanjuk was...

55:42.590 --> 55:55.335
They brought Russian women and they built barracks in our yard for them,

55:55.335 --> 56:07.903
not the rich ones, and they used to serve them, you know, and they used

56:07.903 --> 56:19.410
to live there. When the war started to go bad, they brought in...

56:19.410 --> 56:20.670
Demjanjuk? Whom did they bring?

56:23.940 --> 56:26.370
Russian women, too.

56:27.010 --> 56:27.230
But what was Demjanjuk's role in all this? I didn't understand that.

56:35.570 --> 56:35.800
Who?

56:35.800 --> 56:36.740
Demjanjuk, what did he do?

56:36.740 --> 56:38.242
He was in that camp between Sobibor and Piaski. He was trained there and probably he helped. I worked

56:38.242 --> 56:39.760
in the Waffenkammer, it's in my book, I used to clean the bullets which they used to shoot children.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.366
They brought Demjanjuk, it was in the papers. [laughs] I was there, not that I gave an interview to anybody,

56:41.366 --> 56:42.854
and he was there during the day they had training. They had shortages in the army, they were already

56:42.854 --> 56:44.386
confused, like they said, and they didn't have transport. Demjanjuk used to come to the Waffenkammer,

56:44.386 --> 56:45.948
you know? We used to clean the bullets and put them into the guns and we cleaned out the guns, when there

56:45.948 --> 56:47.020
were no transports. And they used to take him away to kill the children.

58:40.490 --> 58:43.260
Because children were killed by bullets? Oh yes.

58:43.580 --> 58:44.870
Not by gas?

58:44.870 --> 58:51.480
Don't forget that I was almost the last one there.

58:54.620 --> 58:58.000
So how did you land in the Waffenkammer?

58:58.320 --> 59:04.550
In the Waffenkammer? When they didn't have no transports, they didn't have... Anything to sort. I understand. Where was your brother by then?

59:15.740 --> 59:23.099
My brother went to a farmer, he jumped away before they took us to Sobibor. My brother jumped

59:23.099 --> 59:30.221
from the barracks and went to Matsemiok, to that gentile. Who took him in. I didn't know

59:30.221 --> 59:36.710
that he survived, you know. I forgot he'd gone. And then, when I escaped from...

59:59.480 --> 59:59.610
Sobibor.

59:59.610 --> 01:00:14.163
..the camp, the night before we had planned the escape and the Russian soldiers were with us, you

01:00:14.163 --> 01:00:29.167
know. We were inmates, maybe a couple of hundreds, that's all. You know, we weren't such a mass,

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:43.571
because they stopped it or whatever. We went to sleep and everybody said goodbye and we figured,

01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:58.274
what can we do, they will take us. That was already towards the end. I went to sleep, and I dreamt

01:00:58.274 --> 01:01:12.678
my mother came to the camp and she said, you go to Matsemiok and there you survive. From Sobibor

01:01:12.678 --> 01:01:27.081
to Matsemiok would take me a day or a few hours. But as I climbed the fence I got a bullet here.

01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:41.785
And I came to a farmer and I told him, showed him. They knew already, good for you, you killed all

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:56.639
of them, you know? Then I told him, he said I'll heal it for you. I killed a pig. An old man kept

01:01:56.639 --> 01:02:11.793
me twelve days, I didn't tell him where I wanted to go, I told him the opposite because I was still

01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:26.196
afraid. He said, don't worry, my son will take you out into the woods. It took me two weeks to

01:02:26.196 --> 01:02:40.900
get there, to Matsemiok. I came into the barn, you know, I knew his lair and I came into the barn.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:55.304
There was me and two friends. We came into the barn and I said, here we're going to wait until

01:02:55.304 --> 01:03:09.857
Mantsemiok. I asked around, is he alive, and they said, after two weeks my brother was sitting on

01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:19.159
top on the world and I was underneath. Waiting for Mantsemiok.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.630
And Selma Engel was with you, and Chaim?

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:41.910
No. Samuel Lerer and one of the cooks and a Russian, Abraham, I don't know anymore. So I lay there

01:03:41.910 --> 01:04:00.730
and my brother said I'm a ghost, you know. You wait so long, I made it very fast for you.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.490
You did, yes, incredibly fast. So you knew you were going to escape? You were told to be prepared?

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:23.861
Oh yes! I put on my uniform, I mean, we've put on like two pairs of underwear, not everybody in the

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:35.590
camp knew. They told me not to put on many. How many pockets I had, I should have put in sand.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.240
Why?

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:52.382
Because if you throw sand in the face you can stick a knife in the stomach. We were trained

01:04:52.382 --> 01:05:06.860
that there. The Russians and my cousin, the Polacks killed him. He was outside already.

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.530
And he was one of the organizers of the uprising. Yes.

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:10.670
Wasn't he? Together with Pechersky.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:12.000
Yes.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.230
So you were really trained for the outbreak? Oh yes!

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:23.240
Tell me about it.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:34.450
I had all pockets full of sand. And they told us, if you

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:44.860
throw sand and he grabs his eyes, you can stick him.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.530
That's very clever.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.100
Yes.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:56.060
So did you see those Russian women coming?

01:05:56.350 --> 01:06:15.060
Yes, the Russian women, sure! They were from us, like my house maybe, they built barracks for them.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.700
Did you have any contact with them?

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:23.194
No. You weren't allowed. But we could say hi. We all knew how to

01:06:23.194 --> 01:06:27.280
speak Russian, but you were very careful, you didn't know.

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:46.550
You spoke Jiddish in the camp or what language, Polish?

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:49.610
Mostly we talked German.

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:50.010
German?

01:06:50.010 --> 01:07:07.940
Yes, because they didn't like, Was verdrehst Du den Kopf wieder, you know. You had to talk German.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:14.030
If it's not too difficult, would you mind to describe a day, a normal day in Sobibor?

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:24.363
We got up in the morning, we had the entrÃ©e, you know, and they gave you a cup of

01:07:24.363 --> 01:07:34.570
coffee, sometimes you saved a piece of bread from the night time, and you went to

01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:44.400
work. The Germans loved to work there. This way they didn't go to the front.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:50.560
Ja. At that time it was pretty important for the...

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.160
There were already...

01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:00.200
So then you went to work, which was sorting clothes.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:01.420
Yes.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.310
And then?

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:16.426
And then we got ready, we knew they scared those going on vacation. It wasn't

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:28.350
big, maybe thirty people, men. Germans used to watch us, that's all. In the sorting place? In the place where you worked?

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.510
Yes. And in the evening they used to lock us in.

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:51.030
Were they cruel in the sorting place or was it just working?

01:08:51.490 --> 01:09:01.205
The sorting place? We were just working and putting things together, packing

01:09:01.205 --> 01:09:11.048
them up neatly to send them away. There used to come a lot of customers. They

01:09:11.048 --> 01:09:19.230
probably stole it and used to sell it to those who used to come. But was there any cruelty in the sorting place or was it only outside?

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:40.607
The barracks were used down to the ground and there was no heating or

01:09:40.607 --> 01:09:46.559
anything during the winter, you know. In the summer there wasn't airconditioning,

01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:50.360
and I guess those Nazis who had privileges were sent.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.630
To Sobibor.

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:15.170
Yes. First of all that was already the end of the war. And second, they felt they lost the war.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.910
Okay, you came to your shelter and you found your brother.

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:48.093
Yes. I told him that we were planning already to escape, you know. He said, I had to think that

01:10:48.093 --> 01:11:06.660
we are planning an escape and that I escaped and then got a bullet in the head and I was wounded.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:24.270
And he said, we're not gonna tell Montsiniok that we came with three other people, two other

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:42.454
people. Whatever he'll give us to eat, you gonna share it. If you could come with two, we are

01:11:42.454 --> 01:11:56.810
not gonna send them away. He was there already as long as I was in Sobibor.

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.830
Was it a safe place?

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:08.911
He had a farm. Montsiniok was a rich man and he bought a lot of ground and he built a farm

01:12:08.911 --> 01:12:19.992
and he felt, you know, it's a strange country for him and and that's it. He remembered

01:12:19.992 --> 01:12:29.720
my father and he said that he would do anything to save my father's children.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:36.870
It's always the same man you talked about in the beginning?

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:38.040
Yes.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.440
Okay. So you stayed in the barn?

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:54.491
Yes! We stayed almost a year, not a year, eight, nine months we stayed. With my brother,

01:12:54.491 --> 01:13:07.313
you know. He supplied us, helped us, he was very happy that we survived. And I'm still

01:13:07.313 --> 01:13:19.989
friends with his children, they get a thousand dollars every Christmas. We brought them

01:13:19.989 --> 01:13:33.102
a lot of jewellery, you know, that we had stolen from the Sortierungsplatz during the last

01:13:33.102 --> 01:13:44.029
days, but it wasn't enough. But he helped us. We survived because of him.

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:52.640
And because of your God.

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.340
Yes.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.080
You just told me you became very religious.

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:09.747
Yes, I became religious. He was very religious, it's

01:14:09.747 --> 01:14:17.700
so easy to become religious when you are in trouble.

01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:30.060
If you say religious, can you explain a little bit? Did you follow prescriptions?

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:38.013
No. We just believed. I guess that if you help somebody, or you are nice

01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:44.287
to somebody, you get in return. Martin isn't alive, but if you'll ever

01:14:44.287 --> 01:14:49.690
be in Israël, we have a monument put for him on the way to...

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:06.060
At Yad Vashem?

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:06.242
Yes. We felt he deserved, he had six children and God forbid they would have found us, he

01:15:06.242 --> 01:15:06.429
would have gone with the children. We made a monument there for the oldest children and for

01:15:06.429 --> 01:15:06.612
him at Yad Vashem and we felt they deserved it. And when the war was ending he was afraid

01:15:06.612 --> 01:15:06.793
of the Russians, because he was a Russian, Montsiniok. He was afraid, so we took him out

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:06.980
and we got him settled and we put him in business and the children. I will show you letters

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.130
of the children. We always support him. They all were in America already.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.775
Now you were still in the barn in hiding with your brother and

01:16:46.775 --> 01:16:49.880
two more, Samuel Lerer and somebody else, when the war ended?

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:01.540
Yes! Sure!

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.820
So what happened?

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:22.637
Lerer is one. The other one passed away. He had a sister all the way out, within

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:41.180
a year he passed away. He was older than we. He was a cook with the Ukrainians.

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:51.910
But I'm trying to get back to your story. You were in hiding and then the Russians came?

01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:53.350
Yes.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:18:03.020
So then?

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:03.020
So we all went out to Chelm

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:14.343
and there they took care of us already. Montsiniok said we should open a bakery shop,

01:18:14.343 --> 01:18:25.404
he'ld supply us with the bread. But we didn't have no feelings for Polacks, so they didn't help us.

01:18:25.404 --> 01:18:35.957
No, they didn't help us, they harmed us. Wherever

01:18:35.957 --> 01:18:43.839
they saw a Jew, they probably hurt him, but not as those Jews.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.420
Did they harm you?

01:18:53.450 --> 01:19:07.828
No. I was very lucky. And then, I always was in company, I was with my brother, and so we didn't

01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:19.860
have no problems. Then I found my husband and the Polacks wanted to be nice to us.

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:22.610
You found your husband in Chelm?

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.340
I knew him from Chelm. From before the war.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:34.280
How did you meet him?

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:40.738
We were in the same company as his friend and we used to come into the house and that's how

01:19:40.738 --> 01:19:47.544
we met. No, we knew each other before the war. He was older, but we were like in the same company,

01:19:47.544 --> 01:19:53.170
you know, the same crowd I would say. My husband is a college graduate in Poland.

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:22.040
Did you like him already before the war?

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:28.972
Oh, he was handsome, rich, they were the richest in our city, so what's

01:20:28.972 --> 01:20:31.180
there not to like? Now he's sick and I try to help as much as I can.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.460
You should.

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:50.760
Nobody has to teach me this.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.280
Yes, sure. So you met him, he was also coming to Chelm, what...

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.350
From Russia.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:04.210
...had he been doing? From Warsaw?

01:21:04.210 --> 01:21:11.552
Yes. I didn't meet him, I knew him, you know, Chelm wasn't such a big

01:21:11.552 --> 01:21:18.190
city. I knew him. We started talking and that's how it happened.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.010
And you stayed in Chelm? When did you leave?

01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:44.643
No, we left, we didn't wanna stay, it was dangerous. All the Polacks were too dangerous. So,

01:21:44.643 --> 01:21:55.504
we left the minute we could leave. When the Russian army started to occupy Germany we moved with

01:21:55.504 --> 01:22:05.120
them. Because we felt the safest place still would be Germany, same with the Polacks.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:05.870
Yes?

01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:12.380
They were miserable.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.890
You thought the Polacks were more dangerous than the Germans?

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:19.640
Oh yes!

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.800
Despite all your good experiences?

01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:35.819
We were very afraid of the Polacks. They thought they lost

01:22:35.819 --> 01:22:44.300
the war, the Jews have everything, I hope you are Jewish?

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:44.790
I am!

01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:56.654
You know, why should they get everything and they didn't get nothing, they lost the war. They

01:22:56.654 --> 01:23:08.020
were miserable, the Polacks. At night we had to lock ourselves in, I'm telling the truth.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:16.020
You didn't get protection from the Russians?

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:30.629
We used to get protection, but not the protection that we needed. And then, when

01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:44.509
I came, my husband's father passed away soon, he survived. He had owned half

01:23:44.509 --> 01:23:59.119
the city at least. He didn't ask for return, no, he was afraid, he passed away

01:23:59.119 --> 01:24:10.989
soon after the war. That's why we followed the army to Germany.

01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:16.230
So when you left Chelm, where did you go to?

01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:18.670
They said...

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:19.230
To Germany?

01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:25.961
No, the Germans were still fighting the Russians, the war was on. But

01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:32.400
we followed with a big crowd, we were there too. It was dangerous.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:42.590
And where did you end up?

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:53.767
We didn't have a place to land. Nobody wanted us. One was afraid, that maybe they were recognizing

01:24:53.767 --> 01:24:57.360
that he did something to the Jews or helps the Nazis, you know, it wasn't so easy.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.560
So you went West.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:30.973
We figured we will follow, the Germans are now not dangerous. Because they had the wrong

01:25:30.973 --> 01:25:43.760
things to settle or to hide, you know? So it wasn't easy until we came to the States.

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:50.880
But you went through a DP camp?

01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:52.830
No.

01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:55.300
But you didn't go straight to America?

01:25:55.300 --> 01:26:00.260
No. But I had friends, Polacks, who I knew they didn't do nothing wrong

01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:05.084
to help the Germans. And I was with them, I had the Montsiniok, and all

01:26:05.084 --> 01:26:09.230
the children were in America already. I didn't forget them.

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:39.510
But can you please tell me what your itinerary was from Chelm to America?

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:49.952
First of all we had family who left before the war. And as for

01:26:49.952 --> 01:26:58.480
politics, you figured maybe there will be more freedom here. Yes?

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:09.470
And America had a good name [laughs].

01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:12.270
Sure, but from where did you leave?

01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:19.340
From where I left? I left from Germany.

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:19.630
From Germany.

01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:24.260
I didn't wanna be in Germany.

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:29.360
So you came here in '45?

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:30.420
Yes.

01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:32.250
Were you already married?

01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:37.960
Sure! I came with my husband.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:42.390
You married in Chelm?

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:43.924
No. We married in Poland, in Lublin. Because we didn't

01:27:43.924 --> 01:27:45.130
wanna just hang together [laughs], you know?

01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:02.250
Sure. You had an official Jewish wedding?

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:03.267
Oh yes! I didn't have a wedding dress. But (we had) a coppoel, a rabbi in Germany,

01:28:03.267 --> 01:28:04.248
and we had, you know, not dressed up like a bride, but right away we got married,

01:28:04.248 --> 01:28:05.120
because we felt, our parents and we also didn't feel like, you know...

01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:44.370
Where did you enter the United States?

01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:56.390
We came here, wait a second, more than fifty years ago.

01:28:56.610 --> 01:28:57.470
But where? Did you come through New York? Yes!

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.470
[laughs] I'm just asking you.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.970
Yes. We came through the...

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:13.320
The...?

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.350
Yes.

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:20.700
And then they received you in New York?

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:35.237
There was an organization like the Joint and they helped you. They arranged your passports and stuff

01:29:35.237 --> 01:29:49.921
like that. Listen, they had a big organization, and when we came we didn't have no things up on our

01:29:49.921 --> 01:30:04.313
sleeves, you know, and we got our papers. And we came here, we had friends here already. My brother

01:30:04.313 --> 01:30:18.851
was before us, because my brother's wife is German-born. But this didn't have nothing to do with

01:30:18.851 --> 01:30:31.500
it, her parents were still alive, German Jews, nice people. They are not alive anymore.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.080
And then you lived in New York? Or you came here immediately?

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:52.490
We looked for people to be close, you know, we were without people, you understand.

01:30:52.490 --> 01:31:02.570
What a mess I'm telling you. And I lost Leon, Leon died, the Polacks...

01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:04.040
Feldhauer, yes?

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:13.185
Yes. A lot (of people) from Europe that we had known

01:31:13.185 --> 01:31:21.460
before the war went here, so we weren't special.

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.200
So you came immediately to Fineland?

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.050
Yes.

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:25.320
And you stayed.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.420
Yes.

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:27.510
Wonderful. [laughs]

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:37.574
Yes, we were very successful here. If you want to work,

01:31:37.574 --> 01:31:43.090
no matter where you come from, you can make it.

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:51.380
How many children do you have?

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:51.850
Two.

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:52.660
You have two children.

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.630
Yes. Aha. So do you...

01:31:53.630 --> 01:31:59.550
Both very well educated.

01:31:59.550 --> 01:32:03.830
I have seen that. I have seen Abby.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:29.317
One is married already, one granddaughter, she's a doctor in Jefferson Hospital and he is

01:32:29.317 --> 01:32:51.657
a doctor in Jefferson Hospital. And one grandson is a heart specialist and an emergency whatever.

01:32:51.657 --> 01:33:12.845
One is professor, how should I say, he is very educated, she's a manager of a college. One

01:33:12.845 --> 01:33:31.270
is in college, one is in a high school, one finished college and is in business.

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.370
Gosh! Enormous. What else can I ask?

01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:32.750
Sure.

01:33:34.210 --> 01:33:39.270
Oh, and one is in law school.

01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:40.260
Pfff.

01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:40.290
A girl. Gosh.

01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:40.600
So I did pretty good.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:43.650
You did. Now, do you think and dream a lot about Sobibor?

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:54.680
Oh, always.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.170
Or do you try to forget? Always?

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:15.545
Always. You cannot get it out of your mind. My oldest son is very much involved in the Holocaust, you

01:34:15.545 --> 01:34:35.025
know. I will show you, I went yesterday with him and he arranged a new college they opened up in Jacksonville.

01:34:35.025 --> 01:34:49.370
And he wanted me to go, I went with him. You know. And he's very much involved.

01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:57.680
But we are talking about you. You said it never gets out of your mind?

01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:01.660
No. I mean, my husband and the second son went to Chelm, this summer. You know why? Because

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.531
my husband's father just died the minute the war was ended. He came out, he also had been

01:35:04.531 --> 01:35:07.275
hiding, so we built a fence around the cemetery, because there was no place to bury him

01:35:07.275 --> 01:35:09.609
except in Chelm. And my husband went this summer with one of my grandsons.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:57.770
For the next nine months?

01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:12.457
[reads from a book] For the next nine months we lived in a bunker under the barn Heidl had built.

01:36:12.457 --> 01:36:27.447
We lived like mice, only going out through the hay at night to get a drink of water from the horse,

01:36:27.447 --> 01:36:42.135
outside the barn. Mr. Montsiniok at the risk of his own life and his family's lives allowed us to

01:36:42.135 --> 01:36:56.822
stay. He brought us food when he could. There is no question he saved us. Yes? The area was still

01:36:56.822 --> 01:37:12.721
controlled by the Nazis and growing bands of Polish partisans anxious to kill Jews. Finally, the Russians

01:37:12.721 --> 01:37:27.409
drove the Nazis westward and we came out of hiding and returned to Chelm. There I learned that my

01:37:27.409 --> 01:37:42.247
mother had been shot and killed by the Nazis. Poland was not a safe place for Jews, returning Jews

01:37:42.247 --> 01:37:53.150
were resented and often murdered by their Polish neighbours. Is it good?

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:54.030
Very good.

01:37:55.330 --> 01:38:06.532
A group of us, including my future husband, Ees, decided to stay close to the Russian army as it went

01:38:06.532 --> 01:38:17.401
towards Germany. In 1945, when the war ended, we found ourselves in Berlin. Ees and I got married,

01:38:17.401 --> 01:38:28.381
but on our honeymoon he was accused of being an English spy by the Russians and sentenced to death.

01:38:28.381 --> 01:38:37.920
After three years of death row I was able to bribe him out of jail. Should I go again? No.

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.500
We were stateless people and did not dare to go back to Poland. We hoped to come to

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:47.356
America and to start our life there. But not until 1950 were we able to come to America.

01:38:47.356 --> 01:38:52.102
Before leaving for America another Sobibor survivor came to me and told me he had just

01:38:52.102 --> 01:38:55.910
seen Erich Bauer, the Sobibor gas master, on a carrousel in the park.

01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:56.932
We had them arrested and I testified at his trial where he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

01:38:56.932 --> 01:38:57.856
This was the first of many trials where I would testify. This also started my telling

01:38:57.856 --> 01:38:58.520
of the Sobibor story, which I'm still telling to you today.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.492
Thank you. It's enough. Thank you so much. Can I ask you the question, can you tell me what happened

01:39:00.492 --> 01:39:02.290
to your husband? You haven't told me yet. You were in Berlin and your husband got arrested?

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:04.000
No. He has a problem with his leg. He cannot walk.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.380
Oh yes. Three years they gave him. What exactly happened? You said they gave him three years. But can you tell me, it was very short.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.210
Yes, in 19.., I said, no.

01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:50.902
[sentenced] He was, this was the first of many trials that I would testify. This also started

01:39:50.902 --> 01:40:33.043
my telling of the Sobibor story, which I'm still telling you today. Oh, here. Before leaving

01:40:33.043 --> 01:41:12.943
for America, another Sobibor survivor came to me and told me he had seen Erich Bauer, the

01:41:12.943 --> 01:41:45.669
Sobibor gas master, on a carrousel in the park. That's what you wanted?

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.281
No, I want your story, can you put that aside please? Can you

01:41:49.281 --> 01:41:52.470
leave that for a moment please, what you have written?

01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:53.380
Yes.

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:55.270
So can I ask you a question please?

01:41:55.270 --> 01:42:00.770
Yes. [turns pages] What happened.

01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:01.852
Just put it down for a moment, please, because I want you to

01:42:01.852 --> 01:42:02.880
remember it. What happened to your husband? What exactly?

01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:25.615
What happened? My husband went to Russia. Instead of remaining with the Germans, he left to Russia.

01:42:25.615 --> 01:42:38.040
There he was accused of being a spy. When he came back, they put him for three years in jail.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.800
In Berlin?

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:45.997
Yes. And I saved enough money and bribed a Nazi Besetz,

01:42:45.997 --> 01:42:51.180
I'm sorry for the word, and they let him go.

01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:59.330
But was he picked up from the street, or how did it happen in Berlin?

01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:05.870
He went for his passport, I think.

01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:09.200
Yes? And then they arrested him? Gosh.

01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:19.570
The Germans. Okay?

01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:23.813
And then we agreed that we would talk a little bit about

01:43:23.813 --> 01:43:27.300
religion, how you became religious in Sobibor.

01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:49.943
I think I became religious because most of the religious people in Sobibor, they

01:43:49.943 --> 01:44:05.530
were the last of the Polish Jews. That's why they finished them all.

01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:10.830
But you became religious, what did religious mean?

01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:24.669
I came from a religious home and it's much easier when you have something to hang on [laughs]

01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:39.527
when things are bad. Some people stopped being religious, but I just came from a home where my parents

01:44:39.527 --> 01:44:51.910
were religious and they always blamed it on their God, whoever, it was easier for me.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.570
To be religious?

01:44:54.570 --> 01:44:55.240
Yes.

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.890
Were you the only one in Sobibor, or were the other girls religious?

01:44:59.950 --> 01:45:14.423
No. But when it was Yom Kippur, we all prayed as much as we could. If you are not religious,

01:45:14.423 --> 01:45:28.268
you know, you blame that maybe on I don't know whom, but when you have a little belief

01:45:28.268 --> 01:45:38.180
in yourself it's much easier to go through a thing like that.

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.900
And does religion help you now?

01:45:43.690 --> 01:45:44.800
Yes!

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:45.730
Tell me.

01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:50.560
I think with raising the family. We are closer, because we have the religion in between us.

01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:09.660
So did you ever ask God why is this happening?

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:18.750
We cannot ask God, but if you're religious you don't ask too much. Am I right?

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.140
Yes.

01:46:23.730 --> 01:46:35.390
And I feel that it was much easier to go through, in Sobibor, if you believed.

01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:46.400
But it didn't take the shape of special actions, it was in your head?

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:57.463
No, I figured every night when I went to sleep, that I survived, you know, that surviving

01:46:57.463 --> 01:47:05.623
was such a big word. I guess, the way I was brought up... I didn't have enough time really

01:47:05.623 --> 01:47:12.629
to do something else. You know? Because I felt faith gave me a lot of strength.

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:42.437
I imagine. Also while we were having lunch, Esther, or cookies,

01:47:42.437 --> 01:47:50.930
you said you recognized Demjanjuk? That you knew who he was?

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.010
When?

01:48:19.190 --> 01:48:29.360
When you read about him, you know who Demjanjuk was, you said.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.500
With coffee and cookies?

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.550
When we were eating cookies.

01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.950
Yes.

01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:44.870
Yes, you told me that you recognized John Demjanjuk.

01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:45.550
Oh, Demjanjuk?

01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:46.140
Ja.

01:48:46.140 --> 01:49:02.937
I mean, I have now a paper where he was young. Very young. In Sobibor, probably. I remember faces, listen,

01:49:02.937 --> 01:49:17.200
I've been to so many trials, I never made a mistake. I went to more trials, all of them.

01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:25.780
How come? You were asked?

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:40.260
I don't know, maybe I was interested in going to trials and I was very

01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:54.415
anxious to get it where it's supposed to be. No, I didn't think about

01:49:54.415 --> 01:50:06.050
belief to take revenge, but I wanted to get it off my chest.

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.070
Because it's always there.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.740
And will never go away.

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:21.050
So you want Demjanjuk also to be punished?

01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:23.810
Yes.

01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:32.950
So your first trial was in Berlin?

01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:34.300
In Berlin, yes.

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.470
And then many more followed.

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:42.515
Then I went to Gomerski. Clea gave me the boots and Gomerski was a dog,

01:50:42.515 --> 01:50:48.390
they don't come any worse. And then I went to eleven guys on trial.

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:08.920
In Hagen?

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:09.453
To Hagen. There were two brothers, Wolfs, and one Wolf was so good, I mean, he was not guilty

01:51:09.453 --> 01:51:09.974
in nothing. And the other one was a dog! Then I went to whose trial? Again? I went to many.

01:51:09.974 --> 01:51:10.536
And then, when they made the gas chambers in Sobibor, they didn't have it when we came, that's

01:51:10.536 --> 01:51:11.115
when they got the idea to make gas chambers, but first they made it just for children and youngsters.

01:51:11.115 --> 01:51:11.500
And then they made it wherever they could get some people to do it.

01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:20.110
Have you ever been near the gas chambers?

01:52:26.650 --> 01:52:33.360
No. I shouldn't lie. No. I don't know what's inside. I saw them walking to the door.

01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:48.870
That you could see from your place?

01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:55.989
Yes, because we always felt, let's see what's going on, let's see how they're

01:52:55.989 --> 01:53:03.275
doing it. You know? It was curiosity, maybe we'ld have to tell it sometimes. Yes. But

01:53:03.275 --> 01:53:10.060
you saw the people going naked from where they got undressed to the gas chambers.

01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:20.950
So you had no hope, no?

01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:34.920
No. I don't know if I didn't have, I always thought they don't mean me. [laughs] Stupid huh?

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:38.480
You were there? You are still there.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:42.942
Yes. You saw them walking naked through the walkway to the gas chamber. I never

01:53:42.942 --> 01:53:43.284
saw the door to the gas chamber, but I knew where they were going. You didn't

01:53:43.284 --> 01:53:43.610
see if they punished somebody and took him there. And you didn't see him.

01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.650
Is that the image which haunts you most?

01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:35.060
No, it was very hard for me to build an image.

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:49.082
You know? We knew the people were not there, we saw they took out, sometimes

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:58.885
if the things were spoiled, we saw they used to bring them in on wagons, all

01:54:58.885 --> 01:55:08.430
sorts of things. But you couldn't picture them dead. I don't think so.

01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:12.950
How do you take people and just kill them?

01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:20.814
It's impossible. But if you have your nightmares,

01:55:20.814 --> 01:55:25.780
is it the scare of Sobibor, is it a special image?

01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:30.771
Mostly, I will have (nightmares) about the Nazis, you know.

01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:34.070
Who either was favourable to everybody, or was a dog.

01:55:47.210 --> 01:55:55.230
Is there anything you haven't told you still want to tell about your life or about Sobibor?

01:55:55.230 --> 01:56:00.129
Listen, the pictures are here for me, the books are here, I'll live with them

01:56:00.129 --> 01:56:05.029
until I die. You cannot erase, that's impossible. Why? And then the why is so

01:56:05.029 --> 01:56:10.176
big. You know? It's so big, why did they have to kill those little children? They

01:56:10.176 --> 01:56:14.579
didn't give them nothing, no power, no mourning, nothing? Am I right?

01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:51.310
Absolutely. I can't answer it for you.

01:56:54.610 --> 01:57:07.478
I cannot. I mean, you don't have to be a murderer, a killer. I don't know what you have to be

01:57:07.478 --> 01:57:19.940
when you have children at home and you see them dead here from the other end, from the door.

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:26.698
Do you also have this feeling towards the Poles, the Polish population?

01:57:26.698 --> 01:57:28.870
That kind of question towards the Poles which haunted you?

01:57:35.230 --> 01:57:45.628
Oh yes! The Polacks waited to get everything that the Jews had and (they) didn't have, you

01:57:45.628 --> 01:57:55.913
understand, and they were big anti-Semites. They thought that if the Jews have a few onions

01:57:55.913 --> 01:58:05.519
more in their gardens it's the Jews' fault. The Poles were very, very anti-Semitic.

01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:22.220
Thank you very much, Esther.
